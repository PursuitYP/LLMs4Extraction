Both the treatment and control groups had methylprednisolone pulse therapy 1520mg/kg which was gradually tapered and oral administration of pyridostigmine bromide an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. If patients were already taking methylprednisolone or similar drugs the drugs would be withheld for 48 hours before this treatment. The treatment group also had 250mL Shenqi Fuzheng Injection intravenously once daily with the treatment course lasting for 20 days for both groups. The clinical absolute and relative scoring system was used to evaluate the treatment effect during the steroids pulse therapy Table 2 12. The clinical absolute score system evaluates the patients in the following eight aspects ptosis upper eyelid fatigue eyeball horizontal movement upper limbs fatigue lower limb fatigue facial muscles chewing and swallowing functions and respiratory muscle function 12. The clinical absolute scores ranges 064 with 0 being the least severe or normal while 64 is being the most severe.The clinical relative score is equal to pretreatment clinical absolute score posttreatment clinical absolute score/pretreatment clinical absolute score.\n",

Classically perioral dermatitis develops secondary to the use of topical corticosteroids or facial cosmetics.1 Young women age 1645 years are most often affected although cases involving children and men have been reported.12 Treatment requires cessation of the offending agent with or without the addition of antibiotics such as tetracycline or erythromycin.15 Without adequate treatment the disease tends to run a persistent and fluctuating course. While perioral dermatitis has been closely associated with topical corticosteroid use the emergence of this condition in patients taking systemic corticosteroids has rarely been reported in the literature.6We report a 37-year-old woman with no significant past medical history who was admitted following 2 days of generalized muscle weakness blurry vision difficulty swallowing and voice changes. She was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis MG following a positive edrophonium test single fibre electromyography that demonstrated severe dysfunction at the neuromuscular junction and positive anti-MuSK antibody. Antibodies against skeletal muscle and acetylcholine receptor binding were negative.\n",

These findings suggest that the possible pathogenesis of hypercalcemia in primary hyperparathyroidism may be attributed to the increased calcium reabsorption in the kidney and the increased intestinal calcium absorption as a result of stimulated production of 125-OH2D3 in the kidney. It thus follows that the renal tubular effect rather than the skeletal effect of the PTH excess may play a pivotal role in the development of hypercalcemia in primary hyperparathyroidism.

Although themechanisms underlying the effects of thymoma on MG remain unclear several possibilities exist. For example thymoma is more common among older patients so that MG may be relatively more severe in patients with thymoma 11.

Therefore the additional immunotherapies such as those with steroids are anyways required in many MG patients after thymectomy. The same fact was recognized even in our study.A limitation of this study was that we compared a little different time periods of the two groups. Because results of treatment generally improve with time by various causes this factor might influence results of our study. However significant effect of preoperative programmed high-dose steroid treatment was remarkable high as an independent predictor of the modified PR in MG patients after thymectomy in the multivariate analysis Cox regression analysis   0.008. Thus taking this thing together with our other previously mentioned data and previous reports we considered that the result had sufficient reliability.The autoimmune nature of the disease underlies the rationale for using steroids considering that the beneficial effects of this group of drugs have been observed in other autoimmune diseases. The mechanisms of action of steroids in MG patients are poorly understood.\n",

Our cohort of patients was analyzed between 2011 and 2016 therefore pneumococcal pneumonia vaccinations were accounted for from 2006 onward. The vaccinations of interest for vaccine preventable infections VPI were seasonal influenza and pneumococcal vaccines PCV13 and PPSV23. Development of an acute MG exacerbation associated with VPI was defined by the presence of VPI at the time of ED visit/ hospitalization. Diagnosis ofVPI was established by documented laboratory tests including microbiology assessment blood/sputum cultures or imaging that supported diagnosis of seasonal influenza or pneumonia.\n",

Methods This retrospective chart review at 3 institutions identified 92 patients who had undergone MMF taper after achieving either pharmacologic remission or minimal manifestations status. Statistical analysis was performed to assess differences in patient characteristics between patients who had successfully tapered MMF and those who relapsed. Results Of 92 patients undergoing a taper 30 relapsed. The relapses were mild transient and usually responded to increased MMF dose. MG crisis did not occur. The mean dose at time of relapse was 888 mg/day. Patients with relapses were tapered more quickly 8.4 vs. 62.4 months. Conclusions Tapering MMF appears safe after years of disease stability. Reducing the dose at a dose of only 500 mg/day every 12 months is recommended.

Although it is known that MGC scale is a valid instrument for measuring clinical status of patients with MG 25OHD levels did not correlate with myasthenic weakness measured by MGC score.Vitamin D exerts its biological function not only by influencing cellular processes directly but also by influencing gene expression via the vitamin D receptor.

Previous studies have revealed the role of vitamin D in several neurological disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis multiple sclerosis Alzheimers disease Parkinsons disease and stroke 71821.

    "paragraph": "2 q  0.1439 p  .362. 4 end. Discussion. Vitamin D has been shown to exert a multitude of effects on the autoimmune systems and its deficiency is increasingly associated with a wide range of immune-mediated disorders. However there are few studies about association of vitamin D in autoimmune neuromuscular disorders. MG is a prototypic autoimmune disease and autoantibodies to the AChR are present in approximately 80% of patients. Various peripheral immunomodulatory mechanisms including suppression of autoreactive clones by regulatory T cells Treg normally eliminate autoreactive cells. Treg is essential for self-tolerance and defects in Treg can cause experimental autoimmunity 8. Functional defects of Treg have been reported inin patients with myasthenia gravis. J Clin Neurosci 2018 https//doi.org/patients with autoimmune disorders 910. The immuneregulatory effect of vitamin D is mediated by increasing the amount of Treg populations. Vitamin D also had the capacity to inhibit T-cell proliferation 1112. Experimental studies have demonstrated the administration of nave CD4CD25 Treg to AChR-immunized animals prevents experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis 13.\n",

Age-associated changes multimorbidity and the possibility of an alternate diagnosis are possible explanations for the delay in diagnosis.

    "paragraph": "In interpreting the significance of our findings one needs to consider the mechanism by which prednisone decreases the progression from OMG to GMG. While the exact action of prednisone as an immunomodulating agent is not known it is possible that corticosteroids may delay the onset of GMG without altering the underlying immunopathology. The majority of patients with myasthenia gravis require ongoing immunosuppression with either corticosteroids or other medications that suppress the immune system. This suggests that prednisone may not permanently change the immune system but may well play an important role early in the disease course which may prevent the patient from developing GMG. Further study of the actions of corticosteroids may help to clarify this issue in the future.Selection bias is a potential problem in any retrospective study. We found in our untreated patients who served as internal controls that 34% went on to develop generalized myasthenia gravis at 2 years which is in agreement with 41% as reported in the literature 1.The decision to use steroids in the treatment of ocular myasthenia gravis is controversial 14.\n",
