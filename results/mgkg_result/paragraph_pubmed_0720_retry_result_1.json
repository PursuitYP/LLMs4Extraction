        "paragraph": "Introduction. Central serous chorioretinopathy CSCR is a condition characterized by the accumulation of subretinal fluid at the posterior pole of the fundus causing single or multiple areas of serous retinal detachment. The pathophysiology of the disease is thought to involve retinal pigment epithelial RPE dysfunction increased leakage of choriocapillaris vessels and Bruchs membrane dysfunction 1 2. The result of localized exudation is the formation of retinal edema and small RPE detachments at the macular and perimacular areas. Although the aetiology and triggering factors of CSCR are not clearly understood the condition is commonly associated with the use of systemic or topical steroids 2 3. Consequently a critical therapeutic step is the withdrawal of any steroids the patient might be using.Case Rep Ophthalmol 2013416DOI 10.1159/000351856 2013 S. Karger AG Basel www.karger.com/copStefaniotou et al. Multifocal Central Serous Chorioretinopathy Associated with Steroids in a Patient with Myasthenia Gravis2Unfortunately when steroids are indispensable for the treatment of a patients systemic disease the management of CSCR becomes challenging. Here we report our experience in such a clinical setting. Case Report.\n",

Indocyanine green angiography excluded neovascularization and polyp-like vascular abnormalities. Low-fluence photodynamic therapy PDT was performed. We administered verteporfin i.v. at a dose of 6 mg/m2 over 10 min waited for 5 min and then directed the diode laser at the larger lesion of leakage in OD using a wavelength of 689 nm and laser energy of 25 mJ/cm2. After the first application the laser spot was directed at the second and the third lesion of leakage in OD fig. 3a end. As the patients myasthenic symptoms improved it became possible for the attending neurologist to reduce the dose of prednisolone increase the dose of azathioprine and add neostigmine. One month later and while undergoing prednisolone tapering his BCVA in OD had improved to 6/10 with no subretinal fluid while the area with the fibrin deposition had nearly disappeared fig. 3b end. The BCVA in OS improved to 10/10 over the next couple of months. To date 1 year after treatment the patients BCVA remains stable at 6/10 in OD and 10/10 in OS with no signs of active disease. The patients myasthenia is currently well controlled with azathioprine and neostigmine.\n",

Neither study demonstrated any difference between mycophenolate and placebo. The authors do not suggest that mycophenolate therapy shouldbe discontinued which raises the question of how the results of these studies should be interpreted. Does mycophenolate lack efficacy in myasthenia gravisThe authors of these two studies discuss several possible explanations for the negative results other than lack of drug efficacy. For the MSG trial8 the authors suggest the following the 12-week duration of that trial may have been too brief or the response in patients receiving prednisone alone could have been unexpectedly good perhaps because of differences between subjects in this study and those in the preliminary studies that provided the impetus for the current trial. In fact improvement was seen in a remarkable 77% of patients in the placebo group.8 This figure raises concern that something is amiss a problem may have resulted because both the mycophenolate and placebo groups were also taking prednisone.\n",

        "paragraph": "In the MSG study patients were excluded if symptoms were too severe of if they had received steroids IV immunoglobulin IVIg or plasma exchange within the preceding 3 months or thymectomy in the prior year. However in practice patients with severe MG would be treated first with some combination of steroids IVIg and plasmapheresis and would also likely receive a steroid-sparing agent perhaps azathioprine or mycophenolate in anticipation of the need for more long-term immunosuppression. In effect the MSG study was designed to exclude the patients who might have been those most likely to benefit from treatment with mycophenolate.Notwithstanding the limitations of these trials the authors are to be congratulated for undertaking and completing two complicated trials in a rare dis-ease within a relatively short time. From these data we can conclude that in patients who have not yet proven to be steroid-resistant mycophenolate offers no advantage over modest-dose 20 mg/day prednisone for the short term 12 weeks and in patients taking 20 mg/day of prednisone treatment with mycophenolate for 9 months offers no benefit with respect to improvement in either myasthenic symptoms or lowering the dose of steroids.\n",

Background To determine the efficacy of low-dose immediate-release tacrolimus in patients with myasthenia gravis MG with inadequate response to glucocorticoid therapy in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study. Methods Eligible patients had inadequate response to glucocorticoids GCs after 6 weeks of treatment with prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day or 60100 mg/day. Patients were randomized to receive 3 mg tacrolimus or placebo daily orally for 24 weeks. Concomitant glucocorticoids and pyridostigmine were allowed. Patients continued GC therapy from weeks 14 from week 5 the dose was decreased at the discretion of the investigator. The primary efficacy outcome measure was a reduction relative to baseline in quantitative myasthenia gravis QMG score assessed using a generalized linear model supportive analyses used alternative models. Results Of 138 patients screened 83 tacrolimus n  45 placebo n  38 were enrolled and treated.\n",

Custom-designed prednisonesteroid use and MG survey was sent out to MG registry participants as part of semi-annual follow-up. Data were collected and analyzed for frequency. Results A total of 398 MG participants 21% response rate completed the survey including 173 men and 225 women. Among them 298 reported current 174 or past 288 prednisone intake. Current prednisone dosage varied from 0.5 to 75 mg median 10 mg IQR 720 dosing frequency was daily in 132 76% and every other day in 31 18%. Peak prednisone dose was commonly between 25 mg and 60 mg Median 50 mg IQR 2560 however doses more than 60 mg daily were reported in 59 20%. Prednisone AEs were reported more commonly in women 95% vs 81% p < 0.0001. Women reported more intolerable AEs 77% vs 50% p < 0.00001 and less willingness to accept a dose increase 26% vs 44% p  0.03 compared with men. Conclusions Prednisone is commonly used in the treatment of MG with highly variable dosages and dosing frequencies reflecting the absence of a standard guideline. Intolerable AEs were more commonly reported among women and was associated with unwillingness to accept a dose increase.\n",

        "paragraph": "That is not what we observed in our case. Therefore the diagnosis of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis seems very unlikely.Myasthenia is also an autoimmune disease causing weakness of striated muscles. The antibodies acetylcholine receptor antibodies target the neuromuscular junction causing accelerated degradation of acetylcholine receptors and inducing a functional acetylcholine receptor block. Moreover the complement activation induced by acetylcholine receptor antibodies may be the primary cause of neuromuscular transmission failure. Other antibodies may also be involved 11.In our case the patients weakness was initially attributed to thyrotoxicosis as suggested by the raised serum creatine kinase value before the convulsions. Nevertheless the finding of normal concentrations of thyroid hormones strongly suggestive clinical and electrophysiological data the dramatic effect of the neostigmine injection and the high concentration of circulating acetylcholine receptor antibodies led us to a second diagnosis of associated myasthenia gravis 12.The association of Graves disease with myasthenia gravis was first described in 1908 13. Since then this association has often been reported 1417. Of note up to 17.5% of known myasthenic patients were found to have hyperthyroidism 2.\n",

It is of utmost importance to exclude myasthenia gravis in patients with hyperthyroidism who have neuromuscular symptoms. Mycophenolate mofetil for myasthenia gravis a clear and present controversy. Correspondence Chad Heatwole Department of Neurology The University of Rochester Rochester New York USA Email chadheatwoleurmc.rochester.edu Abstract Mycophenolate mofetil MMF has been used to treat myasthenia gravis MG for over 10 years. MMFs use in the MG population stems from its theoretical mechanism of action and the medical literature that supports its benefi t in MG patients. Recently two large double-blinded placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials were initiated to study the effectiveness of MMF for MG. One of these studies found no benefi t in taking MMF with 20 mg of prednisone as compared to taking prednisone alone while the other study demonstrated no advantage in taking MMF against placebo during a 36-week prednisone taper. This article critically reviews the medical literature on MMFs use in MG and suggests further research avenues on this topic. 2008 Dove Medical Press Limited.\n",

Unfortunately a therapy that meets all of these characteristics has yet to be discovered. While corticosteroids are the most commonly used therapy for MG other immunosuppressing agents are also used 1 In cases where MG is refractory to corticosteroid treatment 2 As steroid-sparing agents and 3 In cases where severe corticosteroid side effects occur.Currently available immunomodulating medications have varying mechanisms of action and side effect profi les. Immunomodulating medications frequently used for MG include azathioprine cyclosporine cyclophosphamide tacrolimus intravenous immunoglobulin IVIG plasma exchange PLEX and mycophenolate mofetil. Thymectomy has also been identifi ed as an immunomodulating therapy for MG yet its true effi cacy has yet to be defi nitively proven.

Although there was no direct comparison group in this study the rate of decompensation to generalized myasthenia was thought to be equal or lower than ocular myasthenia patients taking azathioprine and/or corticosteroids compared with a separate retrospective study Sommer et al 1997 Chan 2008. Of the 4 patients who discontinued MMF during Chans study 3 cited persistent diarrhea while 1 discontinued the medication secondary to cost.After much anticipation in 2008 the results of 2 large scale double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials were published which tested the effi cacy of MMF in MG Sanders et al 2008 The Muscle Study Group 2008.

Early reports and studies appear to hint at MMFs effi cacy while the latest placebo-controlled trials did not defi nitively prove its benefi t compared with placebo. Each of the above described articles is not without criticism. Early case reports are thought provoking but are subject to positive study bias. It is not known how many times MMF was previously used for MG without effect. Such failures are typically not submitted to or accepted by major publications. In addition signifi cantNeuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment 2008461208confounding factors exist in many of the early publications. Most patients in these studies had a history of prior or coexisting treatments including corticosteroid use azathioprine cyclosporine thymectomy IVIG pyridostigmine or full body radiation. In many cases these therapies were being used or withdrawn during the evaluation period of MMF thus complicating the interpretation of results. In cases where a therapy had been discontinued prior to MMF use it is possible that long term or even delayed effects could have been inappropriately attributed to MMF.\n",

Varied explanations have been proposed such as criticisms on the 1 Length of the studies 2 Selected patient populations 3 Concurrent use of prednisone 4 Multicenter approach and 5 The primary effi cacy measures. Many clinicians have adamantly defended MMFs use based on prior clinical experience while dismissing the results of the latest two clinical trials. The scientifi c and clinical communities should be careful not to completely disregard the results of these latest two trials. Instead these trials should be accepted for what they are two pieces of evidence in a rich tapestry of knowledge on MMFs use for MG.In some aspects it is not overly surprising that the latest recorded effects of MMF in MG were negative.\n",

While the Muscle Study Groups trial was well planned carefully executed and adequately analyzed it only addressed the question of MMFs usefulness in a very small subpopulation of MG patients over a very specifi c and perhaps too short time frame in the context of both concurrent prednisone use and a specifi c and perhaps understudied primary endpoint. While some literature suggests the early effi cacy of MMF the retrospective study of 85 patients reported a maximal objective benefi t only at an average of 26.7 weeks Meriggioli et al 2003. It is possible that a separation in effi cacy wouldhave been demonstrated had the trial been carried out for a longer period of time. Also while quantifi able few would argue that the QMG score is the perfect measure of therapy effectiveness. The MSG study was powered to detect a difference of 3 points on the QMG score between the two arms. It is diffi cult to know for certain if this was the most appropriate clinical difference in which to base an outcome measure.Likewise there are similar limitations in the 2008 Sanders et al MMF clinical trial.\n",

We discuss the anesthetic management of two myasthenic patients undergoing emergency surgery for sigmoid perforation and upper gastrointestinal bleeding respectively. In both cases we opted for rapidsequence induction with high-dose rocuronium to prevent inhalation of gastric contents. We also report on the implication of neuromuscular monitoring.

Both propofol and remifentanil were administered by target controlled infusion. Sugammadex 16 mg/kg was a key element of the emergency reversal plan. A videolaryngoscope a laryngeal mask airway and a LMA Fastrach Teleflex Medical srl Varedo Italy were also available in the operating room in case of difficult intubation or a cannot ventilate cannot intubate scenario.1214Neuromuscular function was monitored by acceleromyography using the Tof Watch Sx device Organon Ltd Dublin Ireland at the ulnar nerveadductor pollicis unit. Quantitative neuromuscular monitoring was started immediately before rocuronium administration so as to verify proper device operation and check for adequate muscle response. No fade was detected after the first stimulations and monitoring was done throughout the procedure.\n",

In these patients the pharmacodynamics of succinylcholine are unpredictable as the effective dose in 95% of patients ED95 is increased up to 2.6 times and such resistance can cause prolonged onset time216 which is particularly undesirable in RSI.Nondepolarizing NMBA may show a large variability in duration of neuromuscular block but it is usually much prolonged longer even with the use of small doses.3Additionally the concomitant action of anticholinesterase therapy may reduce the effect of anti. cholinesterase used for reversal increasing the risk of cholinergic crisis.14517 It is therefore important to check for the presence of fade at TOF before the administration of any neuromuscular transmission affecting drugs because the need for nondepolarizing NMBA could be even lower than expected in such patients.18Data from the literature suggest that in most myasthenic individuals 0.51  ED95 of nondepolarizing NMBAs provides adequate neuromuscular block for laryngoscopy.1419 It is therefore . safe to conclude that routine dosage should be reduced by 5075% taking into account the possibility of fade before administration of neuromuscular transmission-interfering drugs e.g.\n",

Moreover the cases described a real-life setting we used an uncalibrated monitoring and we only recorded the absence of fade before NMBA administration without determining the exact initial value of TOF ratio and we decided to include a period of close observation in an intensive setting even if data on neuromuscular function were suggesting complete recovery.Onset time of nondepolarizing NMBA is ultimately a pharmacokinetic process and depends upon the speed at which molecules reach the biophas. e which in turn depends on the gradient between blood and the biophase. Our decision to administer full dose of rocuronium 11.2 mg/kg was based on these considerations as well as on published literature24 aiming at rapid airway control this important safety issue could have not been achieved with succinylcholine to which myasthenics may prove resistant.2 In both cases we decided to avoid induction without muscle relaxants partly because of the higher risks of poor tracheal intubation conditions and also especially in the second case because of the risk of adverse he.\n",

Here we present data to support the longitudinal construct validity of the ocularQMG and also report our experience with the ocular-QMG score in 35 patients with MG who were followed by a single physician in a neuromuscular clinic at Emory University.METHODS Ocular component of the quantitative myasthenia gravis score. The ocular-QMG score includes three items each performed in a timed fashion.

The end of a pyridostigmine treatment period was defined by the remission of symptoms the discontinuation of pyridostigmine the addition of prednisone to the treatment regimen or the end of follow-up. The end of a steroid treatment period was defined by remission of symptoms discontinuation of prednisone or end of follow-up.Because the therapeutic strategy of the treating neurologist involved the initial use of pyridostigmine followed by steroids if required by symptoms and then a steroid taper once remission was achieved we considered only periods of treatment with pyridostigmine that preceded periods of treatment with steroids. The analytic approach that we have used focuses on treatment epochs rather than patient treatment groups for several reasons. Some patients contributed an epoch of treatment on both pyridostigmine alone and then on prednisone.\n",

MG patients admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine between June 2011 and January 2017 aged between 18 and 70 with grade III and grade IV according to the modified Osserman scale were recruited and received a telephone follow-up in September 2017. Our department is a well-known tertiary referral center for MG. Patients clinical and laboratory data were collected retrospectively. Diagnosis of MG was based on their history clinical symptoms positive outcomes of pharmacological and electrophysiological tests and antibody tests 7. Diagnosis of MG was confirmed by assessing serum AChR-Ab titers in most cases. Patients with elevated levels of liver enzymes renal insufficiency impaired glucose tolerance malignant tumor severe infection patients undergoing thymectomy within one year pregnant and lactating women at baseline were excluded. All subjects were contacted and received information about the aim of this study and written consents were obtained. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine. 2.2 end. Treatment. Patients were divided into two groups.\n",

Additionally Ponseti and colleagues reported that post-thymectomy administration of tacrolimus combined with prednisone was more effective than prednisone alone for the consolidation of complete stable remission in a shorter period of time in MG patients which proved the ability of tacrolimus in improving clinical symptoms of thymectomized MG patients 36. The other reason is that patients who underwent thymectomy had a significantly lowerMG-ADL score than patients without thymectomy in the control group. Consistent with an international randomized trial conducted by Wolfe and colleagues showed that patients who underwent thymectomy combined with prednisone had a lower quantitative myasthenia gravis score over a 3-year period than those who received prednisone alone 37. In summary although there were more patients underwent thymectomy in the tacrolimus group the two-way ANOVA still showed patients treated with tacrolimus had more favorable outcomes in improving MG-ADL score and reducing the number of hospital admission.Tacrolimus treatment showed the positive effect of improving MGADL score in MG patients.\n",

Patients and methods We treated nine patients with MG all women age range 3583years mean 51.1years MGFA classification 4 type IIa 4 type IIb and 1 type IVb patients with FK506 for more than 24months observation period 2446months. All the patients had undergone extended thymectomy before FK506 treatment two patients 22.2% had noninvasive thymoma and six 66.7% had thymic hyperplasia. We evaluated total Quantitative MG Q-MG score anti-acetylcholine receptor AChR antibody titer in the blood interleukin 2 IL-2 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs administration dosage of prednisolone PSL and adverse effects of FK506. Results A reduction in steroid dosage of 50% without worsening of the symptoms was observed 1year after FK506 administration in three out of six steroid-dependent MG patients 50.0%. The total Q-MG scores range 039 points at 6months and 1year after FK506 administration improved by 3 points or more in six 66.7% and seven 77.8% out of nine patients respectively. The efficacy of FK506 was maintained for more than 2years. Although adverse effects were observed in three patients 33.3% these were not serious.\n",

During the 5 years of follow-up 3 patients had an increased titer of anti-AChR and they experienced a worsening of symptoms during this period. 3.5 end. Adverse events. Table 2 shows adverse events for which therapies were needed during the 5-year follow-up. Most of these events were considered to be associated with steroid use such as bone disease and infection. Three of the 9 patients developed kidney stones. There were no severe adverse effects in any of the patients. 4 end. Discussion. We report here the data from 9 patients with steroid-dependent generalized MG treated with low-dose tacrolimus 23 mg/day for 5 years who had either repeated exacerbations of MG and difficulty in reducing PSL dose or difficulty in treating with a high enough dose of PSL because of severe side effects of PSL in spite of the severity of MG. There have been several reports of long-term follow-up of treatment of MG with tacrolimus however most of these have been 23 years follow-up.\n",

Tacrolimus improved muscle strength at only 2 weeks after the treatment commenced in a 2002 study 11 and other studies also showed significant clinical improvement for example in lower limb muscle strength 8 MG-ADL and serum levels of anti-AChR antibodies 14 shortly after patients were started on the drug. None of our patients was treated with IAP during 5 years follow-up although 4 patients received IAP treatment before the initiation of tacrolimus. MG-ADL scores also continued to decrease to 24 months after administration of tacrolimus and were then stable from 24 to60 months. On the other hand anti-AChR antibody titers showed no change at 3 months after initiation of tacrolimus but decreased gradually thereafter. We needed more time to see the effects of tacrolimus compared to previous studies.Treatment with tacrolimus can decrease the required dose of oral steroids.\n",

In a study by Konishi et al. in 12 MG patients who had an MG-ADL score of 23 at baseline and with 88104 weeks of follow-up half of the patients showed improvement at the end of the study and PSL dosage could be reduced in 7 patients 58% with a mean reduction ratio of 37% 12. Ponseti et al. reported that all 40 patients treated with tacrolimus could stop PSL treatment 7 and the same group reported that after initiation of tacrolimus PSL treatment could be withdrawn in 91.6% of patients after the first year and in 95.1% at the end of the study 6. In the latter study mean follow-up time was 49.3 months and the data suggest the usefulness of starting treatment with PSL/tacrolimus in the early post-thymectomy period 6. In our patients none could stop PSL after initiation of tacrolimus although low-dose tacrolimus could reduce the oral dose of PSL.\n",

        "paragraph": "One of these patients wanted to discontinue tacrolimus and the other patient became HBs-antigen positive and experienced liver dysfunction. In the latter patient steroid pulsed therapy had been administered immediately prior to the development of liver dysfunction so it is not clear whether liver dysfunction was due to tacrolimus alone.There are some limitations of this study because of the relatively small numbers of patients treatedwithmultiplemodalities the lack of controls and the retrospective nature of data collection. Furthermore this study may include clinician bias regarding benefit of therapy and clinical improvement over 5 years may in part be due to the natural course of the disease. This study however provides some information about the 5-year long-term use of tacrolimus. In our study 5 patients experienced some worsening of symptoms during the 5 years of follow-up however in general the efficacy of tacrolimus was maintained for 5 years without renal impairment or glucose intolerance. For further evaluation of tacrolimus for the treatment for MG data from studies with larger numbers of patients and longer followup are needed.References1 Meriggioli MN Sanders DB.

We hypothesized that a long-term low-dose prednisone regimen for ocular myasthenia gravis OMG would have a low rate of major side effects. Methods Consecutive OMG patients from a single institution over a 16-year period and treated with 1 month of daily prednisone were included. Steroid-related complications were defined as the development/worsening of conditions requiring alteration to medical therapy. Serious complications included conditions requiring emergency care hospitalization or surgery. Results Eighty-three patients with follow-up period ranging from 1 to 271 months median 58 months were included. Fifty-eight 70% patients had follow-up period of24 months. The maximum prednisone dose ranged from 10 to 60 mg. Tapering to 10 mg/d required 4 months for all but 2 patients. Median average daily dose following the initial course was 5 mg daily interquartile range 47.5 mg.\n",

W e read with great interest the recent article by Bruce and Kupersmith 1 discussing the safety of prednisone in treating patients with ocular myasthenia gravis OMG. Yet before treatment there are critically important steps in evaluating these patients. We illustrate this point by presenting 2 cases of OMG that were found to have invasive thymoma. Case 1 A 50-year-old Hispanic man presented with a 4-month history of ptosis and diplopia which was worse in the evening and better in the morning. He had no other symptoms. Visual acuity was 20/20 bilaterally. External examination showed bilateral variable ptosis which increased with sustained upgaze mild orbicularis weakness and positive Cogan lid twitch sign.\n",

Cholinesterase inhibitors such as pyridostigmine improve the efficiency of neuromuscular transmission but do not fully compensate for the reduced function of acetylcholine receptors.Although controlled trials of corticosteroids in MG have not been carried out prednisone or prednisolone in Europe is the initial immunosuppressive treatment currently used in most patients. The optimal dosage and schedule of administration have not been defined the cumulative burden of steroid side effects is high and severe complications are not rare.2 Many patients and physicians resist using high dosages of prednisone and are highly motivated toe-Pub ahead of print on April 23 2008 at www.neurology.org.

Favorable results in refractory and steroid-dependent MG patients have been reported in open-label studies revealing a rapid onset of action and a safe side effect profile. Drug eruption due to toxicity or immune-mediated damage has not been reported in association with MM. A 32-year-old man with generalized seropositive MG with a highly malignant clinical course was admitted to the authors department due to an acute papulosquamous psoriatic-like skin eruption 1 month following treatment initiation with MM. Skin biopsy revealed sparse perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes intermingled with few eosinophils. Treatment with high-dose steroids together with discontinuation of MM induced a gradual improvement with complete resolution of the symptoms 2 months later. A severe and fulminant skin eruption in association with MM treatment is described for the first time in the literature. The histopathologic diagnosis of drug eruption is supported by the resolution of symptoms following discontinuation of MM.\n",

Glycopyrrolate is the antimuscarinic drug administered concurrently with neostigmine to prevent parasympathetic effects.Patients with myasthenia gravis are at increased risk of PORC because of existing neuromuscular transmission and functioning deficits. Myasthenia gravis is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes antibodies to target and destroy acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. This decrease in the number of functioning acetylcholine receptors results in muscle fatigue and variable weakness.8 Implications for general anesthesia include characteristic symptoms of myasthenia gravis such as airway management dysphagia dysarthria aspiration pneumonia due to nasopharyngeal muscular weakness and difficulty in expelling airway secretions.8JBI Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports2018 Joanna Briggs Institute.\n",

Both MMF and placebo-treated groups improved to the same degree during the blinded phasethere was no significant difference in the mean change in QMGS between the two groups. Improvement was unexpectedly high in both groups 85% in the MMF and 77% in the placebo group were judged by the site investigator to have improved with 37% in the MMF and 39% in the placebo group having marked improvement. During the open-label phase the prednisone dose was reduced by a similar amount in the MMF 8 mg/day and placebo groups 11 mg/day. The improvement was also similar in most secondary outcome measures in both groups. Study 2 end. An International Phase III Randomized Trial of Mycophenolate Mofetil in Myasthenia Gravis. In August 2004 Aspreva Pharmaceuticals began a parallel steroid-sparing study with the goal of seeking regulatory approval for MG as an added indication for MMF.16 This was a prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group international multicenter trial to assess the efficacy and safety of adjunct MMF in 176 subjects aged 1880 years with generalized mild to moderately severe AChR-ab-positive MG who had taken at least 20 mg/day prednisone for at least 4 weeks TABLE 1.\n",

        "paragraph": "Although a validated assessment tool in MG QMGS is not routinely used by many centers. Lack of experience of the participating sites with this scoring system may have affected the study results. Also the composite outcome measure used in the Aspreva trial may have been too rigorous to demonstrate a lesser but clinically significant response. Conclusions. Obviously these studies have significant implications for MG patients currently taking MMF future MG patients treating physicians and future study designs. Should MMF be abandoned as a treatment for MG based on these studies Opinions about this are sharply divided even among the authors of these papers who have extensive experience with MMF some have stopped prescribing MMF some then had the experience of patients relapsing when it was discontinued and others believe the final answer is not in. While a conclusion that MMF is not effective in MG has the virtue of superficial simplicity and decisiveness the risk is that a potentially useful drug is prematurely set aside because of factors related to the study designs. Our usage of MMF in MG will not be determined by these results alone and we feel that more study will be required before the full potential of MMF in MG is known.\n",

        "paragraph": "Immunosuppression related to HIV infection immunosuppressive treatment organ transplantation and neoplastic diseases increases the risk for Leishmania-infected people to develop visceral illness. Case presentation Three cases of Leishmania infantum leishmaniasis in corticosteroid CStreated patients are reported an isolated lingual leishmaniasis in a farmer treated with CS for asthma a severe visceral leishmaniasis associated with cutaneous lesions in a woman with myasthenia gravis and a visceral involvement after cutaneous leishmaniasis in a man receiving CS. Conclusion Physicians should recognise CS-treated patients as a population likely to be immunesuppressed. In immunodeficiency conditions unusual forms of leishmaniasis can develop and foster the risk of a diagnostic delay and of poor response to therapy. Background The number of leishmaniasis cases associated with immunosuppression has increased regularly over the past 20 years. Immunosuppression related to HIV infection drugs organ transplantation and neoplastic diseases increases the risk for Leishmania-infected people to develop visceral illness. In southwestern Europe visceral leishmaniasis VL is the clinical form most frequently associated to immunosuppression particularly to HIV infection 12.\n",

In the past 7 years some 200 cases of visceral leishmaniasis were recorded from these regions and in most of the patients parasites have been identified as L.infantum by means of isoenzyme analysis unpublished data from Istituto Superiore di Sanit Rome. Our first case is a paradigmatic description of the classical lip leishmaniasis that occurred over centuries in Southern Europe. The finding of a viscerotropic Leishmania as cause of a localized leishmaniasis poses the question whether the lesions observed may represent the site of the parasite inoculation or a secondary localization 10. The absence of clinical immunological and parasitological evidence of generalized parasite dissemination in the first case strongly supports the former hypothesis rather than secondary spread from an initial unknown source. Nevertheless the use of steroids and the elderly age of the patient could suggest a secondary involvement of the tongue 10.\n",

In the female patient affected by myasthenia the relapses the clinical spread to the gastrointestinal tract and the severe T lymphocyte defects were all factors likely to be related to the sustained impairment of the immune response. The third case shows the visceral involvement of a leishmaniasis case initially confined to the skin region only. The cutaneous leishmaniasis must be differentiated from sporotrichosis mycobacteriosis sarcoidosis syphilis lupus vulgaris and neoplasms in general the histologic examination led to the correct diagnosis. The peri-oral lesions shared characteristics similar to those of the postkala-azar dermal leishmaniasis PKDL 15. In our case the diagnosis of PKDL was excluded by the finding of parasites in the bone marrow.The need of an early clinical advice of the leishmanias diagnosis during the evaluation of HIV febrile patients living in an endemic area is well-known.\n",

In 2018 we conducted a multicenter cross-sectional studyin a large population of Japanese patients with generalized MG aiming to elucidatethe correlation between oral PSL regimens and achievement of treatment goals. TheORs for low vs. high dose to achieve treatment goals at 1 2 and 3 years were 10.42.75 and 1.86 respectively whereas the corresponding ORs for low vs. medium dosewere 13.4 3.99 and 4.92. Early combination with fast-acting therapy OR 2.19 at 2years 2.11 at 3 years or combination with calcineurin inhibitors OR 2.09 at 2 years2.36 at 3 years were also positively associated with achieving treatment goals. Theseresults indicate that early combination of low-dose PSL regimens with other therapiesis the key for early achievement of treatment goals in generalized MG. However evenwith this regimen 35% of patients did not achieve the treatment target after 3 years.These results suggest the limitation of the current oral corticosteroid therapy.\n",

Alternative splicing alternative translation initiation of mature mRNAs and post-translational modifications have generated multiple GR isoforms with unique expression gene regulation and functional profiles which have advanced our understanding of the molecular basis of GC susceptibility diversity. Genome-wide GR recruitment studies have shown significant difference of tissue-specific chromatin landscape in GC susceptibility 50.An important challenge in the clinical application of GC is the heterogeneity of GC response between individuals. Advancesin our understanding of GC expression patterns may reveal important mechanisms of poor response in MG treatment. The breakthrough may accelerate not only the design of novel therapeutic strategies for poor responders but also the prediction of enhanced response to corticosteroids for good responders.\n",

Epidemiology . Fracture . Myasthenia gravis . Osteoporosis. Introduction. Myasthenia gravis MG is an automimmune disorder with symptoms of muscle weakness and fatigability in which antibodies reduce the number of acetylcholine receptors at the post-synaptic region of the neuromuscular junction 1. MG is relatively rare with an estimated pooled incidence rate of 5.3 per million person-years and an estimated pooled prevalence rate of 77.7 per million persons 2.\n",

        "paragraph": "In theory the positive effects of acetylcholine on bone turnover could level out the negative effects of oral glucocorticosteroids on bone which would explain our findings. Moreover a recent study performed by Wakata et al. 31 showed that Japanese MG patients who received long-term 8.2 years high-dose prednisolone therapy maximum 80100 mg for 46 weeks had a 50 % reduced osteoporosis rate as compared to the general population. A second explanation for lower HRs in MG patients on glucocorticoids is that generally patients treated with glucocorticoids are exposed to an inflammatory disease. Subsequently the disease may increase the risk for fracture itself like rheumatoid arthritis 32. This inflammatory compound is generally not present in MG patients except for some inflammatory cells that may be present in muscle 33. An alternative explanation is that glucocorticoids may decrease fracture risk associated with the disease thus cancelling out its adverse effects. A last explanation is that MG patients are often treated on alternate days with glucocorticoids 15.\n",

Emerging clinical studies demonstrated that tacrolimus can effectively and safely improve the condition of MG patients even the patients with refractory MG 1728. To date the systematic review and meta-analysis of tacrolimus therapy for MG is still lacking. Therefore we performed one to explore its efficacy and safety. Objectives.

Two reviewers Liang Wang and Suxian Zhang independently judged each risk of bias and evaluated methodological quality of the included studies. The evaluation of methodological quality of the studies included random sequence generation allocation concealment patient blinding observer blinding incomplete outcome data selective reporting and other bias 30. We judged each risk of bias as high low or unclear. The studies would be reassessed if there was any contradiction and an agreement would be reached with discussion. Assessment ofheterogeneity. The Chi-squared test was employed to analyze the presence of heterogeneity and we judged its extent with the I2 statistics. The significance level  was set as 0.1. Statistical heterogeneity was considered insignificant if the p value of the Chi-squared test was 0.1. If the value was <0.1 heterogeneity was thought significant and interpreted in accordance with the I2 statistics.\n",

        "paragraph": "Last most patients evaluated had either OMG or mild GMG MGFA clinical classification type II. There were only seven patients classified as MGFA type III or IV. More patients with MGFA type III or IV or high-quality RCT trials will be needed to further prove the efficacy of TAC monotherapy in MG patients. CONCLUSIONS. TAC monotherapy is a fast-acting and efficacious regimen to alleviate all common symptoms of both OMG and GMG especially for patients with ptosis and bulbar symptoms. Close monitoring of renal function is essential for older patients with hypertension. DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT.

        "paragraph": "Numbers and half-life of AChR are diminished by an antibodyrelated reaction. However approximately 10% to 30% of MG patients lack increased anti-AChR antibody in serum 13 although they respond to therapy for autoimmune disorders. An antibody in these seronegative patients apparently interferes with neuromuscular transmission by binding to determinants other than those on the AChR. Mossman et al. 4 have suggested that this type of seronegative myasthenia is immunologically and physiologically distinct from the seropositive type and thus seronegative MG patients might show different responses to nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs NMBDs from seropositive patients. However little is known about this possibility there is only a case report by Kim andMangold 5. We compared seropositive MG patients seronegative MG patients and non-MG patients with thymoma in terms of neuromuscular responses to vecuronium at the adductor pollicis muscle. Methods end. After receiving approval of the study protocol from the institutional ethics committee and obtaining patients informed consent we studied consecutive seropositive MG patients seronegative MG patients and non-MG thymoma patients n 8 each. Five of these patients have already been described 6.\n",

Taivainen and Meretoja 25 showed that the ED50 and ED95 for vecuronium in the presence of 1 minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration of sevoflurane were 64% and 50% less respectively than values obtained without inhaled anesthetics in neurologically healthy patients. Blockade in MG patients in this study may have been influenced by sevoflurane. We do not believe that background anesthetics affected the result of the study which compared the two types of MG with respect to the sensitivity of vecuronium although it makes potency comparisons with other studies unnecessarily difficult. In addition during the test period the lungs were ventilated by mask and the end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane was not measured. An unstable concentration of sevoflurane might influence the blockade by vecuronium. Two non-MG patients showed a very steep dose-response reaction with 40 g/kg despite no reaction with 30 g/ kg.\n",

Improvement was observed within days of beginning MMF which led to discontinuation of pyridostigmine and reduction in prednisone dose. The improvement was sustained for at least 15 months and minimal side effects were observed during this period.Subsequently several other case reports reported effectiveness of MMF in MG 16-19 .\n",

Conclusion. Prior to the recent trials MMF was finding increasing off-label use in MG both as first-line therapy or as a steroid-sparing agent and for patients who did not tolerate or respond to other immunosuppressants. Case reports retrospective reviews and small or uncontrolled trials had indicated equivalent or superior efficacy to other nonsteroidal agents used for MG with fewer side effects and rapid onset of action. The high cost of MMF was prohibitive for many patients and limited its use. It was thus hoped that these controlled trials would provide evidence of efficacy that would lead to regulatory approval of MG as an indication for MMF. Although the results of these trials do not support earlier reports and the clinical experience of many physicians that MMF is an effective steroid-sparing immunosuppressant in MG many lessons were learned in the process and these will undoubtedly form the foundation for future clinical studies. 6 end.

Improvement of the ocular symptoms began on day 4 after the start of immunoglobulin treatment and all the symptoms disappeared within 14 days. The treatment was followed by a booster infusion given every two weeks plus oral administration of prednisolone and pyridostigmine. The dose of oral prednisolone was gradually reduced to 10 mg on alternate days. However ocular symptoms recurred seven months after the start of treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin. The booster infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin was repeated five times every two or three days. An improvement of the symptoms was not remarkable and intravenous immunoglobulin treatment was discontinued in February 1987. Doses of prednisolone and pyridostigmine were increased but ocular symptoms did not improve.In July 1987 she was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone because she had been treated with oral prednisolone for a long period and oral prednisolone 55 mg on alternate days did not lead to a satisfactory improvement. The improvement of the ocular symptoms was not remarkable after the initial intravenous methylprednisolone and a second course was administered.\n",

We determined the minimal detectable change MDC and the minimal important difference MID at the group and individual level.Results Treated patients had a higher change in MGII scores than controls analysis of covariance p  0.001. The ocular domain changed more with prednisone than with IVIg/PLEX effect size 0.67 and 0.13 analysis of covariance p 5 0.001. The generalized domain changed more with IVIg/PLEX than with prednisone effect size 0.50 and 0.22 analysis of covariance p5 0.07. For the total MGII score the individual MDC95 was 9.1 and the MID was 5.5 for individuals and 8.1 for groups. Relative efficiency ratios were .1 favoring the MGII.Conclusions The MGII demonstrated responsiveness to prednisone IVIg and PLEX in patients with myasthenia. There is a differential response in ocular and generalized symptoms to type of therapy. The MGII has higher relative efficiency than comparison measures and is viable for use in clinical trials.

However the determinants of the response of patients with myasthenia gravis to rocuronium which is expected to be used more frequently since the advent of sugammadex have not been studied.OBJECTIVES To clarify whether previously suggested determinants of the response to other intermediate-acting NMBAs would also affect the response to rocuronium and to reveal the determinants of the increased response to rocuronium in individual patients with myasthenia gravis using multivariate analysis.DESIGN . Case control study.SETTING Kumamoto University Hospital November 2010 to September 2013.PATIENTS Thirty-eight patients with myasthenia gravis having surgery using a total intravenous anaesthetic technique were investigated. After induction of general anaesthesia the 95% effective dose ED95 of rocuronium was calculated using cumulative dose-finding methods.\n",

This study was conducted according to the recommendations of the Helsinki Declaration. Prior written informed consent was obtained from all patients.Patients with myasthenia gravis scheduled for elective surgery under general anaesthesia were investigated regardless of whether they received oral medications for myasthenia gravis treatment or not. Patients with cirrhosis hepatitis cholestasis heart failure or arrhythmia renal dysfunction defined by a creatinine clearance of 30 ml min 1 or morbid obesity BMI 35 kg m 2 were excluded from the study. Patients receiving medications known to interfere with NMBAs such as antibiotics and anticonvulsants were also excluded. The patients were divided into five groups according to the Osserman classification8 based on their symptoms one day before surgery.\n",

We found an 89.4% of MG individuals with nonsufficient levels of vitD in comparison with 68.0% in the group of HV OR  3.96 P  0.024. In addition there was an inverse correlation between 25OHD levels and one of the scores P  0.037 r  0.26 CI95  0.49 to 0.0087. However when we compared 25OHD median serum levels between MG patients and HV no statistically significant differences have been found. This is the first report of vitD status in a cohort of Argentinean MG patients where we found that patients are more likely to have nonsufficient levels of vitD compared to healthy people and that patients with more severe disease have lower levels of vitD. There are limited and controversial studies that address the role of vitamin D vitD a vitamin with immunomodulatory effects in myasthenia gravis MG a neuromuscular autoimmune disease.

We found an 89.4% of MG individuals with nonsufficient levels of vitD in comparison with 68.0% in the group of HV OR  3.96 P  0.024. In addition there was an inverse correlation between 25OHD levels and one of the scores P  0.037 r  0.26 CI95  0.49 to 0.0087. However when we compared 25OHD median serum levels between MG patients and HV no statistically significant differences have been found. This is the first report of vitD status in a cohort of Argentinean MG patients where we found that patients are more likely to have nonsufficient levels of vitD compared to healthy people and that patients with more severe disease have lower levels of vitD. INTRODUCTION. Myasthenia gravis MG is a prototypic antibody-mediated autoimmune disease that affects the neuromuscular junction NMJ. These autoantibodies target different components of the NMJ where the most relevant are those directed against the acetylcholine receptor AChR present in 80% of the cases 12. The remaining 20% of the patients have anti-MuSK LRP4 or agrin antibodies 3.\n",

CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT. The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare that are relevant to the content of this article. Eyelid ptosis enhanced after steroid pulse therapy in ocular myasthenia gravis a case report. Eyelid ptosis is a frequent symptom in myasthenia gravis and severity of ptosis fluctuates along with the disease course 1. Here we describe a patient with ocular myasthenia gravis presenting with ptosis in the contralateral side to primary affected side after edrophonium Tensilon test and steroid pulse therapy. A 39-year-old Japanese woman presented with a 3-month history of diplopia and right eyelid ptosis Fig. 1a end. Her symptoms had diurnal variation worsened in the evening and improved after rest. There were no symptoms or signs of weakness of facial neck bulbar limb or respiratory muscles. The edrophonium test disclosed improvement of the right ptosis and induced minor left ptosis Fig. 1b end.\n",

        "paragraph": "The Effect of Combined Therapy with Immunoadsorption and High-Dose Intravenous Methylprednisolone on Myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis MG is an autoimmune disease mediated by antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor of skeletal muscle antiAChR Ab 1 2. Although the efficacy of plasmapheresis on MG had been reported only in a relatively small-scale controlled study for severe cases of MG 3 a significant reduction in serum anti-AChR Ab titer following plasmapheresis has been considered to be related to the efficacy of treatment 49. However the effect of plasmapheresis on clinical symptoms of MG did not continue and the serum anti-AChR Ab titer increased relatively soon within 1 month after treatment 4 7. In other reports addition of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone therapy HMP immediately after plasmapheresis might have prevented the early phase deterioration in case studies with MG 10 11. Recently particularly in Japan the immunoadsorption method IA has been the preferred treatment for MG because of a lower rate of serum albumin loss and side effects to the circulating system and because the effect is almost identical to plasma exchange or the double-filtration method 12.\n",

The CYP3A53 genotype and co-administration of a Wuzhi capsule significantly affected tacrolimus clearance. A dosing regimen based on the CYP3A53 genotype and co-administration of a Wuzhi capsule in patients with myasthenia gravis was proposed.

If antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor AChR are found in about 85 % of MG patients there are other minor forms of MG with other autoantibodies. In approximately 5 % of MG patients the autoreactive antibodies are directed against a protein called muscle-specific kinase MuSK which plays a central role in the clustering of AChRs and other postsynaptic components at the neuromuscular junction NMJ 1. Recently autoantibodies against the agrin receptor LRP4 low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 a molecule that forms a complex with MuSK have been detected in a small proportion of MG patients without anti-AChR or anti-MuSK antibodies 2 3.The development of autoantibodies in autoimmune disorders is due to a breakdown of the mechanism of tolerance associated with defects in the regulation of the immune system. However each autoimmune pathology has specific features 4.\n",

        "paragraph": "If a regional anaesthesia method cannot be used it is important to optimize the drugs and doses for good analgesia in patients with myasthenia. Opioids can worsen the already affected respiratory function because of their depressant action on the respiratory centre. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs can worsen the symptoms of myasthenia gravis per se. Metamizol should not have any impact on myasthenia gravis8 but our patient had some unexplained respiratory distress in the past after a metamizol injection so we decided to avoid this drug. Our patient had a good preoperative experience with the analgesic combination of diclofenac and orphenadrine so we decided to combine the mentioned analgesia with intermittent boluses of piritramid. This combination of analgesics was very effective during the whole postoperative period.In summary the presented case shows a good experience with the use of rocuronium combined with sugammadex in a patient with myasthenia. With this combination we achieved a sufficient muscular blockade and excellent conditions for the intubation and the surgery.\n",

After 3 weeks she was commenced on MyM 500 mg three times daily in addition to prednisolone and pyridostigmine. She remained well with no subsequent myasthenic crisis over the last 11 months. The prednisolone was progressively reduced to 20 mg every morning while pyridostigmine was further reduced to 120 mg three times daily. 2.4 end. Case 4 end. A 21-year-old Chinese man presented with acute ptosis double vision and limb weakness. He had strongly positive repetitive nerve stimulation and single fiber electromyographic studies. Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies were elevated as well. He was treated with pyridostigmine 120 mg three times daily and prednisolone 40 mg in the morning. He subsequently underwent thymectomy. Postthymectomy he had a total of five admissions within 18 months three of which required mechanical ventilation. His medications included pyridostigmine 120 mg six times per day prednisolone 60 mg and azathioprine 100 mg both every morning.\n",

A retrospective multicenter study of MuSK-Ab MG reported that RTX given in the dose of 375 mg/m2 weekly for 4 weeks and then monthly for the next 2 months was associated with lower relapse rates 18% compared to a regimen of two 1 gm infusions separated by 2 weeks 80%.22 A retrospective Austrian nationwide study of 56 patients with AChR-Ab and MuSK-Ab MG reported that 26% of patients were in remission 3 months after treatment with varying dosing protocols of RTX. At a median of 20 months 43% were in remission and 25% achieved MM status.23 A single center retrospective study of 21 AChR-Ab 3 MuSK-Ab and 4 double seronegative MG patients found that muscle strength improved significantly from baseline at 6 months and then stabilized up to 36 months and PIS was improved in 43% at 6 months.24 A AC CE PT EDCopyright  2020 The Authors.

Consistent with the prior study our results support the safety of low-dose prednisolone for OMG.12 Only minor adverse events were documented in our study. However in patients taking prednisolone specific monitoring measures should be in place to reduce the risks of severe adverse events including worsening blood glucose level excess weight gain worsening blood pressure upper gastrointestinal bleeding osteoporosis avascular necrosis of the hip joint and infectious disease.The strengths of our study are as follows 1 it was the first study to compare low and moderate doses of prednisolone for OMG in terms of initial treatment response 12 weeks and 2 . the doses of prednisolone in our study were calculated per body weight kg which should help in generalization to different populations regardless of body weight.This study had some limitations. First our study design was a retrospective analysis with variable clinical evaluations and investigation patterns which resulted in missing data.\n",

        "paragraph": "The mechanisms of action of immunosuppressant drugs in MG fall into three main categories inhibition of the cell cycle azathioprine cyclophosphamide methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil immunosuppression of T cells steroids ciclosporin and tacrolimus and B-cell depletion rituximab. Data on immunosuppressant drugs in MG derive mainly from clinical experience observational studies and expert opinion. The main drawbacks of the randomized evidence are the small size of most drug trials variations in study design and a lack of head-to-head studies. It is therefore difficult to determine the relative efficacy of each immunosuppressant. Oral prednisolone usually started at a low dose on an alternate-day regimen and gradually increased is the recommended firstchoice short-term immunosuppressant. Long-term immunosuppression regimens vary between different countries and physicians. Azathioprine is often the first-choice drug for long-term immunosuppression and it is usually started together with steroids to allow tapering of steroids to the lowest dose possible. Methotrexate mycophenolate mofetil or tacrolimus should be considered in patients who are intolerant of or unresponsive to azathioprine.\n",

Average daily doses of prednisone were w14 mg/day in both groups at study entry and 5 mg/day and 6.5 mg/day in the tacrolimus and placebo groups respectively during the last 12 weeks of the trial. Interleukin 2 IL2 levels were no different between the two groups throughout the study. There are several aspects of the design of this trial that make the results unsurprising including the population targeted by the inclusion and exclusion criteria and the duration of treatment. This trial aimed to recruit patients with MG who were in minimal manifestation status while taking relatively low doses of prednisone and there was no requirement for steroid dependence however defined. As such this is precisely the population in which one would expect to be able to further reduce the dose of prednisone without triggering an exacerbation of disease. Furthermore all available evidence from previously conducted randomised controlled trials in MG suggests that the steroid sparing effect of drugs such as tacrolimus emerges only after prolonged treatment.\n",

One patient discontinued MMF due to tinnitus which did not resolve with discontinuation of MMF. For the remaining 4 cases the MMF dose reductions were planned to minimize the risk of long-term immunosuppression. For the 13 patients who underwent an exacerbation of MG following MMF discontinuation/reduction there was a lag time of 6118 weeks median 16 weeks. Four patients in our cohort tapered or stopped MMF without having an exacerbation. One of these patients restarted MMF after 2 months within the average post discontinuation lag. Another developed mild leg weakness but this never recovered and we were unable to attribute this symptom to an MG exacerbation. For the group of 71 patients in which no or little change in MMF was made during the period of observation 1 underwent an exacerbation. She did so after sternal repair surgery.Patients older than 60 years were less likely to stop MMF therapy and also less likely to have an exacerbation a classic possible confounder. When this binary age variable was introduced into the Cox regression it was not significant nor did it reduce the apparent large increase in risk due to stopping MMF therapy.\n",

Another study included patients between the age of 12 and 86 but there was no serious opportunistic infection reported Meriggioli et al. 2003b.

An active metabolite of leflunomide A771726 teriflunomide has been investigated as an MS treatment with phase II and III clinical trials already completed 1214.Previous research has shown that experimentally induced myasthenia gravis was prevented by leflunomide Weibin Liu ranliuz163.com1 Department of Neurology The First Affiliated Hospital ofSun Yat-sen University 58 Zhongshan 2nd Rd Yuexiu Guangzhou Guangdong Peoples Republic of Chinain rats 15. In our clinic we also observed that leflunomide could be an effective substitute for azathioprine in myasthenia patients that had poor tolerance to azathioprine. To investigate this we designed a pilot study that evaluated the short-term efficacy and safety of leflunomide in corticosteroid-dependent MG patients. Methods end. end. MG patients.\n",

        "paragraph": "Leflunomide is tolerated well by RA patients and the discovery of only mild side effects in this study indicates similar levels of tolerability by MG patients. However the 6-month study duration may not be long enough to see the development of major side effects of leflunomide in MG patients.Different kinds of immunosuppressants such as cytostatic drugs azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil the alkylating agent cyclophosphamide and calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine A CyA and tacrolimus are currently used to treat MG 8. The main mechanism of action of leflunomide is inhibition of dihydroorotase dehydrogenase which is the key enzyme in pyrimidine synthesis 11.Therefore leflunomide can interfere with T cell mitosis. The pharmacological actions and efficacy of leflunomide in RA patients make it a reasonable choice of immunosuppressant for the treatment ofMG patients. The use of leflunomide also offers another mechanism through the inhibition of pyrimidine synthesis which interferes with lymphocyte proliferation in MG patients.Several shortcomings should be considered in the interpretation of our leflunomide efficacy results. First this pilot study compared the clinical situation of patients only before and after leflunomide treatment. The patients were their own control.\n",

        "paragraph": "Tacrolimus immunotherapy is a valid option for themanagement of MG and can be gradually reduced in dose once symptoms are improved until complete withdrawal is achieved.Keywords Myasthenia gravis Tacrolimus Prognosis CYP3A5 Randomized controlled trial Neurology. Introduction. Myasthenia gravis MG is an acquired chronic autoimmune disease characterized by antibody-mediated skeletal muscle weakness caused by autoantibodies against acetylcholine receptors AChR at the neuromuscular junctions 120. Although there are a number of available therapies for the management of MG immune regulation with the use of prednisolone and azathioprine remains the first-line treatment. However these drugs have shown poor efficacy and safety with significant longterm side effects 1 3.Tacrolimus a T-cell immunosuppressive that was originally used as an antirejection drug in organ transplantation has widely been used in the treatment of MG 1. Tacrolimus inhibits calcineurin activity eventually leading to the inhibition of T-lymphocyte signal transduction and interleukin-2 transcription resulting in T-cell suppression subsequent impairment of cytotoxic T cells and indirect suppression of B cells 4.\n",

In AChR-MG reportsshowing an alteration in Treg frequencies are not consistent Fattorossi et al. 2005 Li et al. 2008 Masuda et al. 2010 Xu et al. 2012 and no changes were observed in Treg frequencies of MuSK-MG patients Yi et al. 2014. Prior to this study Tfr cell subsets have not been well reported in MG and the effect of tacrolimus on Tfr cells has not been reported in either MG or transplantation studies. The decrease in Tregs cells may be attributable to tacrolimus induced suppression of IL-2 a critical cytokine involved in the generation of Tregs Wu et al. 2006. As a result a decrease in Treg cells has consequential effects on Tfr cells which originate from Treg precursors Sage and Sharpe 2016. Given the global suppression of the Th response it may be more beneficial to evaluate the balance of the Th17 vs Treg response Noack and Miossec 2014. The dramatic inhibition of inflammatory Th1 and Th17 cells may outweigh any potential negative consequences of reduced Treg frequencies.This study has several limitations. MuSK-MG patients received a variety of immunomodulatory treatments including some with thymectomy which could confound the results.\n",

Massive doses of vitamin D for refractory severe Myasthenia gravis Am J Case Rep 2016 17 51-54This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported Licenserange. Parathyroid hormone PTH decreased from 42 ng/mL to 8.5 to 9.5 ng/mL normal range 10 ng/mL to 55 ng/mL. A noticeable and direct correlation among vitamin D levels MG severity and antibody levels could be seen. The patient has only had 1 electromyography prior to the beginning of the follow-up but was not able to bring the result to us. Discussion. Medical and scientific thinking about high-dose vitamin D treatment is still confined to the recommended doses for vitamin D replacement which may not lead to many potential effects whereas in this case report vitamin D might have played a pharmacological role as it was given in massive quantities. Due to the lack of studies with supra-physiological doses of vitamin D aiming to achieve pharmacological actions strong evidence that vitamin D improves autoimmune diseases is yet to be shown.\n",

Thus the possible link between vitamin D and the immune system is at least partially known but it is still not completely understood. The chronological associations between complete remission of MG symptoms and vitamin D massive-dose treatment which had not been seen prior to this therapy relapse after a blind discontinuation and new improvement after vitamin D reintroduction show a strong exposure-withdrawal correlation which shows vitamin D to be a key tool as in this case report.Vitamin D could be an option for refractory situations in most autoimmune maladies. Some reports have shown the same vitamin D exposure correlation with improvements in patients with multiple sclerosis MS and other illnesses. Among the autoimmune disorders MS is the most empirically tested for vitamin D massive-dose despite the lack of evidence of longterm safety of massive-dose vitamin D treatment.\n",

        "paragraph": "As sugammadex does not interfere with cholinergic transmission continuation of cholinesterase inhibitors preoperatively does not affect the efficacy of the reversal of neuromuscular block by sugammadex and therefore optimal muscle function is preserved.Several publications demonstrated a very fast onset and markedly prolonged duration of action of nonde polarizing NMBDs in patients with myasthenia gravis1-4. Reversal of neuromuscular block by sugammadex will eliminate the risk of residual neuromuscular blockade in such a vulnerable patient population. Reversal of rocuronium-induced profound neuromuscular block by sugammadex in our patient with myasthenia gravis was rapid efficient and without signs of postoperative residual neuromuscular blockage. Our case suggests that the combination of rocuronium and sugammadex for safe neuromuscular blockade and reversal is beneficial in myasthenia gravis.BIBLIOGRAFA1. Briggs ED Kirsch JR.

It is a calcineurin inhibitor indicated for the prevention of rejectionat UCSF LIBRARY  CKM on March 27 2015tan.sagepub.comDownloaded fromTherapeutic Advances in Neurological Disorders 8294 http//tan.sagepub.comafter heart kidney and liver transplant. Unlike cyclosporine tacrolimus has greater potency and may result in less nephrotoxicity when used at low doses Sanders and Evoli 2010. Depending on the indication the initial dosage in transplant patients may range from 0.075 to 0.2 mg/kg/day which may achieve whole blood trough concentrations of 420 ng/ml. Its immunosuppressive action is suggested to be due to the inhibition of T lymphocyte activation through its intracellular binding to the protein FKBP-12. This complex interferes with the activity of calcineurin which in turn prevents nuclear factor of activated T-cells NF-AT from translocation and initiation of gene transcription for lymphokines such as interleukin-2 IL-2. In addition to causing T-cell inhibition tacrolimus may play a role in the suppression of humoral immunity Astellas Pharma 2013.\n",

Doses of corticosteroids and AChE inhibitors were held constant during the study period however azathioprine was discontinued before initiation of tacrolimus. After 1 and 3 months a statistically significant reduction in QMGS was noted in the thymoma group versus baseline values. The nonthymoma group also demonstrated a reduction in QMGS at those time points but the difference was not statistically significant. The between-group comparison showed a statistically significant improvement in QMGS in the thymoma group versus the nonthymoma subjects. Serum AChR antibody titers were not significantly changed in either group compared to baseline. No adverse effects were observed during treatment Mitsui etal. 2007. end. Discussion.

The pyridostigmine dose was begun at 180 mg daily and increased as tolerated. Main outcome measures Follow up evaluations performed at 1 36 12 and 24 months detailed the frequency of ptosis and diplopia and the amount of ocular motor deviation in primary and downward gaze. Results The prednisone and pyridostigmine groups were similar for age sex acetylcholine receptor antibody level prism cover test results for primary and downward gaze diplopia in primary and downward gaze and unilateral ptosis. Bilateral ptosis was present in 32.4% of the pyridostigmine group and 10.9% of the prednisone group p  0.02. The prednisone group showed resolution in primary gaze diplopia downgaze diplopia unilateral ptosis and bilateral ptosis in 73.5% 75.5% 85.7% and 98% respectively at 1 month. The benefit persisted at 36 12 and 24 months except for the bilateral ptosis. The pyridostigmine group showed resolution in primary gaze diplopia downgaze diplopia unilateral ptosis and bilateral ptosis in 6.9% 17.2% 50% and 76.7% of patients after 1 month of treatment. The prism cover results improved p  0.003 in the prednisone group only.\n",

No change was observed from 4 to 8weeks after which MGC scores again decreased from 8 to 12weeks. Meanwhile we also observed that the MGC scores of the low-dose prednisone group dropped continuously within 8weeks. But there was no significant change in MGC scores from 8 to 12weeks. Generally prednisone typically require 26weeks to induce1 3significant improvements in the treatment of MG 15. The results of our study with low-dose prednisone are consistent with previous reports. However the changes of MGC scores in leflunomide combined with low-dose prednisone group were discontinuous. These results indicated that improvement of clinical symptoms in the first 4weeks was most likely due to the effects of prednisone and the significant improvement in the last 4weeks was likely due to leflunomide.\n",

Fluoxetine treatment for weight reduction in steroid-induced obesity a pilot study in myasthenia gravis patients. To evaluate the weight reducing effect of fluoxetine on steroid-induced obesity we conducted an open clinical intervention study of 2040 mg/day fluoxetine 24 weeks duration. Thirteen myasthenia gravis overweight long-term steroid-treated patients age 3159 2 body mass index BMI 2954 kg/m  were included. Measurements of weight BMI and routine laboratory tests were undertaken at baseline 12 and 24 weeks. Muscle strength and fatigue parameters were assessed at 4 week intervals.\n",

Myasthenia gravis prednisolone thymoma thymectomy. Introduction. Several retrospective studies have shown that preoperative programmed alternate-day administration of prednisolone stabilizes the symptoms of myasthenia gravis MG and facilitates a reduction of the frequency of post-thymectomy myasthenic crisis.1 Although care is necessary because the preoperative use of high doses of steroids might increase morbidity such as wound infection the strategy is now widely used. We encountered a case in which steroid therapy was effective in stabilizing MG as well as inducing apoptosis of both the epithelial and lymphocytic components of a thymoma. Case report. A 72-year-old woman first recognized blepharoptosis in 2004 but did not consult a physician. In November 2007 she experienced weakness of the extremities and myasthenia gravis MG was diagnosed.\n",

However the factors influencing or predicting in exacerbation are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to identify the clinical factors that predict the initial paradoxical exacerbation of MG in response to steroid therapy. Fifty-five consecutive patients who were administered for the first time high doses of prednisone 4080 mg in a tertiary medical centre in Seoul were included. Prednisone-induced exacerbation was defined as a significant reduction in a patients Myasthenia Gravis Severity Scale MSS score within 4 weeks of prednisone administration. We divided the patients into two groups on the basis of whether or not they experienced prednisone-induced exacerbation and investigated the differences between the two groups with respect to clinical laboratory and electrophysiological features. Twenty-three patients 42% experienced definite exacerbation after prednisone therapy.\n",

        "paragraph": "We divided the patients into two groups on the basis of whether or not they experienced prednisone-induced exacerbation and investigated the differences between the two groups with respect to clinical laboratory and electrophysiological features. Twenty-three patients 42% experienced definite exacerbation after prednisone therapy. Older age predominantly severe bulbar symptoms and low MSS score were found to be significant clinical predictors of exacerbation by multivariate logistic regression analysis. A high daily dosage of prednisone relative to body weight was found to be neither a predictor of exacerbation nor a predictor of early improvement in bivariate correlation analysis. Steroid-induced exacerbation in MG is a frequently encountered and challenging problem. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of exacerbation of MG when prescribing prednisone especially when treating elderly bulbar dominant or severely myasthenic patients. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Discussion. Currently steroids are the mainstay of immunotherapy for MG. However a well-designed randomized controlled trial proving the effectiveness of steroids for the treatment of MG has not been performed.10 The reported frequency of steroid-induced exacerbation varies between 25% and 75%71112 but the definition of exacerbation in these studies was inconsistent therefore comparisons between them are difficult. Recent hypotheses for the mechanisms by which worsening occurs are the action of released antibodies from degraded lymphocytes increased activity of cholinesterase in neuromuscular junctions and an overall increase in immune reactions.1315 However the main mechanism is not clearly understood despite many hypotheses. There is also ongoing debate about the optimal treatment regimen for achieving maximal efficacy and minimal side effects.\n",

        "paragraph": "Because there are no objective laboratory tools to measure the severity of MG symptoms our clinical definition is an improvement on the subjective and obscure definitions of worsening used in previous reports. The second problem relates to factors influencing the symptoms of MG. Previous studies did not consider confounding factors such as combined MG medication except for prednisone the presence of thymoma or recent plasma exchange or thymectomy. Our study included only patients who were being treated with prednisone for the first time and who had no history of being treated with other immunosuppressive agents. We analyzed the dosage of pyridostigmine at the time of prednisone addition and we excluded patients who could have been influenced by recent interventions. These factors were not identified as significant predictors. Neither were any of the following predictors presence of thymoma thymectomy or titre of acetylcholine receptor antibody.Developed on the basis of empirical data the large-dose prednisone regimen used in our clinic is a single dose of 60 80 mg per day. In the present study we calculated the dosage of prednisone per kilogram body weight and analyzed whether the dosage was related to either the probability of worsening or the rapidity of improvement.\n",

Unfortunately these agents all carry serious side effects and some patients do not tolerate them or respond adequately to them.

Depending on the disease burden MG patients may experience chronic dysregulation of both the hormonal stress axis and the immune system consequently aggravating the disease itself but also leading to secondary psychopathological abnormalities. A long-term clinical course requires long-term glucocorticoid GC therapy which may change the psychological state by affecting the pituitary-adrenocortical system in MG patients. In this study we investigated the function of the pituitary-adrenocortical system in MG patients who were treated with prednisolone PSL and evaluated their quality of life by using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey and the 28-item general health questionnaire GHQ-28. ACTH and cortisol levels in the plasma of patients who were treated with PSL PSL group n  18 were lower than those in the plasma of patients who were treated without PSL PSLj group n  29 P G 0.05 and P G 0.01 respectively. In the PSL group we confirmed that cortisol levels negatively correlated with daily PSL dosages P G 0.05.\n",

These results suggest that GC administration or intrinsic cortisol had a beneficial effect to reduce anxiety and insomnia in MG patients. In the PSL patients there was no significant correlation between cortisol levels in plasma and anxiety/insomnia scores Fig. 7B end. However there was a significantly negative correlation between the anxiety/insomniascores evaluated by GHQ-28 and corticotropin levels in plasma r  j0.47 P  0.023 Fig. 7A. end. DISCUSSION. In this study we investigated the function of the pituitaryadrenocortical system in 18 MG patients who were treated with PSL compared with 29 MG patients who were treated without PSL. The number of subjects was not enough to show the function of the pituitary-adrenocortical system of the MG patients however our results may provide new insights on the importance of GC treatment for MG patients.

As shown in Table 1 the number of women in the PSL group was the same as that in the PSLj group although the number of subjects in the PSL group was fewer than that in the PSLj group. As such we compared the corticotropin or cortisol levels between men and women but no difference was observed. Next we investigated the influence of GC treatment on the emotional state of the female MG patients. Although there was no difference in corticotropin or cortisol levels between the PSLj and PSL groups 13 female MG patients who had been treated with PSL had also less anxiety and insomnia than the 13 female MG patients who had been treated without PSL as estimated by the GHQ-28 P  0.003 data not shown. This result was similar as to those of all study participants.In MG patients depression has been reported to be caused by the stress of the disease.21 Consequently in 1 study up to 20% of MG patients were initially diagnosed as having a psychiatric disorder.22 In healthy subjects corticotropin levels significantly correlated with cortisol level.23 However as shown in Figure 2A no significant correlation was observed between corticotropin and cortisol levels in plasma of MG patients who were not .\n",

The addition of MM allowed a reduction in the steroid dose requirement in 50% and improvement in the functional grade in 59% of the patients with MG figure A and B. Ten patients 31% who have been taking MM for an average of 8 months 3 to 17 months range have failed to show any benefit. These patients continue taking MM and are being followed up to evaluate a possible delayed response. Myasthenic patients who benefited from the treatment had been taking MM for a longer period of time mean 13 versus 8 months than those who did not benefit and the patients with a more favorable response had a diagnosis of MG established for a shorter time mean 7.5 versus 14 years than the patients who failed to show benefit with MM.Among the three patients with inflammatory myopathy IM one patient who had polymyositis improved.\n",

We determined the levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D 25OHD in patients with MG and in healthy subjects to determine whether vitamin D deficiency is present in MG and whether vitamin D supplementation has beneficial effects on fatigue. Methods Plasma levels of 25OHD were analyzed in 33 patients with MG 22 males mean age 58 years and in 50 healthy age- and sex-matched blood donors without vitamin D3 medication. MG composite score MGC assessed fatigue. 13 patients with MG without previous vitamin D3 supplementation were started on vitamin D3 supplementation cholecalciferol 800 IU/day with a followup examination after 2.510 months mean 6 months. Results Patients with MG without pre-existing vitamin D3 supplementation N  16 had a mean MGC of 4.5 and lower plasma 25OHD levels mean 51  19 nM than healthy controls 69  21 nM P  0.017. Seventeen patients had pre-existing vitamin D3 supplementation because of corticosteroid treatment and their mean 25OHD was 79  22 nM and mean MGC was 5.5. In the 13 patients who received cholecalciferol 25OHD was overall increased at followup with 22% P  0.033 and MGC score improved with 38% P  0.05.\n",

Introduction. Myasthenia gravis MG is an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder in which autoantibodies are directed against muscle receptors in most cases the acetylcholine receptors AChRs 85% 1 or muscle-specific tyrosine kinase MuSK 10% 2. Thymus hyperplasia is common in AChR antibody-seropositive AChR patients with MG and thus T cells are considered to play an important role in the onset and course of the disease 3. The immune-regulatory effect of vitamin D is hypothesized to reside in an increased amount of regulatory T cells and this has been confirmed through recent studiesin healthy individuals 4. In mice with experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis EAMG peripherally circulating regulatory T cells are important for the disease process through controlling self-reactive T cells and thus inhibition of the autoimmune response 5.Insufficient or deficient levels of vitamin D have been reported in a high percentage of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus SLE 6.\n",

M YASTHENIA gravisMG preferen-tially involves theocular muscles.1Ocular myasthenia manifests as weakness of the levator palpebrae superioris leading to ptosis or the extraocular muscles producing diplopia. The precise reasons for this predilection are poorly understood.23 As with all therapies for MG there are few well-controlled studies of treatments of ocular myasthenia.4 Immunosuppressive therapies in particular the corticosteroid prednisone are the mainstay of treatment for generalized MG that compromises an individuals daily activities. Prednisone is also commonly used for ocular myasthenia. However 4 factors should be considered prior to the use of steroids for patients with MG isolated to the ocular muscles 1 Could the patients symptoms improve with safer forms of therapy 2 Will steroid treatment lead to resolution of symptoms 3 Does the severity of the symptoms warrant the risk of steroid adverse effects 4 Do steroids reduce the chance of generalization We consider each of these questions and reach the conclusion that only the occasional case of ocular myasthenia should be treate.\n",

Sommer et al6 used steroids to treat 45 patients with ocular myasthenia more than a quarter of these patients had moderate adverse effects and 2 developed diabetes or psychosis. In all likelihood the reported frequency of steroid adverse effects is underestimated in studies of MG. For example osteoporosis is accelerated in all patients receiving doses of pred-nisone commonly used for ocular myasthenia and bone loss is greatest in the first 6 months of therapy.14 Steroids may exacerbate preclinical hypertension cataract formation and glucose intolerance. Therefore even a short 3- to 6-month course of prednisone treatment is not risk free.Studies of patients with ocular myasthenia consistently show that the risk of generalization is highest in the first 2 years of onset and decreases substantially thereafter.7910 The rate of generalization varies among series but the best estimate is that approximately 40% to 50% of cases will remain purely ocular.9 In studies prior to steroid use or in which steroids were not used 11% to 30% of cases did not gen.\n",

        "paragraph": "Our approach to the patient with ocular myasthenia is to explain the potential evolution of the disease and treatment options including their complications. We institute nonpharmacological treatments and cholinesterase inhibitors and in most patients these provide satisfactory relief of symptoms. In about half of the patients with newly diagnosed ocular myasthenia generalized weakness will prompt institution of immunosuppressive therapies. Only in limited situations are we compelled to use steroids for isolated ocular muscle weakness10 and in these cases it is always the patient who demands the treatment. Young women are often so cosmetically distressed by their ptosis or strabismus that we are convinced to start steroid therapy. Other indications are bilateral ptosis unsatisfactorily relieved by crutches or tape and bilateral severe ophthalmoplegia. Bilateral ptosis precludes useful vision. Severe ophthalmoplegia necessitates head thrusts to achieve vi-sual refixations and seriously impedes quality of life.\n",

He developed respiratory depression after spinal anesthesia which was rapidly recovered by steroids. Case presentation. The patient written informed consent was an 83-year-old man height 152cm weight 46kg. Since the age of 81 he required indwelling catheters for urinary retention due toprostatic hyperplasia and underwent transurethral Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate HoLEP. Medical history. He was diagnosed at our hospital with MG at the age of 81 based on the presence of hoarseness dysphagia diplopia and ptosis. The clinical features improved after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin IVIg pulse steroid therapy and tacrolimus and since then was followed up at the Outpatient Department. At the age of 82 he was admitted for aspiration pneumonia which was likely caused by dysphagia and was subsequently treated with IVIg and pulse steroid therapy. He was prescribed 5mg of prednisolone after discharge but he continued to exhibit bilateral ptosis and complain of dysphagia. Although he enjoyed independent living and was able to walk unsupported at home he used a wheelchair whenever he went outside.\n",

The observation that none of the patients in the placebo group achieved MMS may at least in part be a function of an important element of study designthat all patients were initially treated with pyridostigmine and that those who responded were not randomized to receive study drug i.e. those patients who responded to pyridostigmine alone were not randomized.\n",

Among these the ice pack test has been reported to have both good sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis 1214. This test is performed by having the patient place an ice pack over the ptotic eyelid for 25 min. An improvement of 2 mm or more of the ptosis is considered a positive result 12. Although the mechanism is not fully understood it is thought that cooling improves the synaptic transmission at the endplate 15 and has an effect on the excitationcontraction coupling in the muscle 16 . It has been shown that the improvement in ptosis is not simply a result of rest as the ice test improves the ptosis significantly more than rest alone 1718. Alternatives to the ice pack test include the rest test which is performed by having the patient close the eyes for 2 min and the sleep test for which the patient is maintained eyes closed in a dark room for 30 min. Improvement of the ptosis and/or ophthalmoparesis is considered a positive result. Edrophonium testing. Edrophonium is a short-acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that works by increasing the amount of available acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft.\n",

Rakocevic et al. have shown a significant correlation between abnormal jitter of orbicularis oculi muscles and response to myasthenic treatment. In this study abnormal jitter had a 100% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity for response to myasthenic therapy 43 . In addition to being a useful diagnostic tool SFEMG also seems to be able to predict the severity of the disease 44 . On the contrary SFEMG is not universally available and in many neurophysiology labs RNS studies are the primary electrophysiologic studies. The sensitivity of the latter is highest for facial or proximal muscles. Therapeutic trial. Although it is ideal to confirm the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis before starting any treatment there are uncommon situations in which the clinical suspicion persists despite negative serologic and electrophysiologic testing.

The patient had gained about 30 kg and had developed a significant cushingoid facies over the past 6 months Fig. 1 end. He was unable to climb stairs or carry a bucket of water due to steroid myopathy in conjunction with generalized MG. As the treatment of his disease was not according to international recommendations he was referred to a different neurologist M.D.B. who tapered methylprednisolone and pyridostigmine and added 3 mg of tacrolimus. This resulted in a quick remission. Just 10 weeks after the introduction of tacrolimus to the treatment the methylprednisolone could already be tapered to 4 mg. Two months later however a new subluxation occurred despite optimal medical treatment. To avoid new subluxations lateral tarsorrhaphy was performed.Case Rep Ophthalmol 202011534539DOI 10.1159/000509527  2020 The Authors. Published by S. Karger AG Basel www.karger.com/copDam et al.

Moreover the continuation of a dose of 58 mg or more for more than 6 months is not recommended.Side effects like myopathy are commonly seen with steroid treatment. Careful follow-up is necessary to adjust treatment in case of serious side effect. Extra care and caution must be taken in anatomically predisposed patients with proptosis. In case of prolonged need for treatment other forms of immunosuppressive therapy e.g. azathioprine tacrolimus should be considered.Statement of EthicsWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this report and any presented images.Conflict of Interest StatementThe authors have no conflict of interest to declare.Funding SourcesNone.Case Rep Ophthalmol 202011534539DOI 10.1159/000509527  2020 The Authors.

Seropositivity is more likely to be detected by testing for modulating and blocking antibodies in addition to binding ones16 and by employing an assay that detects AChRs isolated from human ocular muscles.19 It is also possible that antigens other than AChRs are immune targets in these patients.\n",

The dosage of prednisone also reduced at the end of the observation period with only 6 adverse events reported. The immunological impact of tacrolimus was revealed by reduced percentages of Tfh Breg CD19BAFF-R B cells and increased percentages of Treg cells as well as down-regulated expression of IL-2 IL-4 IL-10 and IL-13 mRNA levels in PBMCs during the treatment. Conclusion Our study indicated the clinical efficacy of tacrolimus in patients with refractory generalized MG. The underlying immunoregulatory mechanism of tacrolimus may involve alterations in the phenotypes of peripheral blood lymphocytes and Th1/Th2-related cytokine expression of PBMCs. 2020 S end.

        "paragraph": "A subsequent intravenous edrophonium test 10 mg was unequivocally positive producing marked improvement in right hand strength but having no effect on left upper limb weakness. Assay for AChRAb remained negative. A diagnosis of generalized myasthenia was made.The patient was treated with a gradually increasing dose of prednisolone to a maximum of 40 mg alt diem with subsequent improvement in hand muscle strength after 2 months finger extension and abduction were graded at 4-/5 and at 3 months 415. This improvement has been maintained during a further 6 months despite gradual reduction of the prednisolone dose to 5 mg alt diem.Nations et a1. retrospectively reviewed 234 patients with myasthenia and found that 3% had distal myasthenia defined as distal extremity weakness exceeding proximal weakness by at least one MRC grade. Hand weakness particularly involved the finger extensors and was the sole presenting feature in two patients and developed later in three others l month to 43 years after the initial diagnosis of myasthenia. These patients age range 14 to 43 all had raised AChRAb levels and ocular or bulbar weakness in addition to hand weakness. No patient had a thymoma and six improved with immunosuppression.\n",

Complete stable remission CSR according to the MGFA postintervention status classification 18 is probably inappropriate as a practical landmark to compare the effects of treatments. We therefore set a practical goal of achieving MM or a better status with prednisolone   5 mg/day MM with prednisolone   5 mg/day given that complications of long-term prednisolone emerge at 7.510 mg/day 9 10 .\n",

We previously reported that prednisone reduced the frequency of generalized myasthenia GMG and controlled diplopia without major adverse effects at 2 years in patients with ocular myasthenia gravis OMG. Questions remain as to whether study subjects had longstanding disease biasing results towards a steroid benefit and if prednisone merely delayed GMG onset. Here we performed a record review of a referral neuro-ophthalmology service OMG database for patients who were followed-up for C4 years or until GMG developed. We studied the effect of prednisone on GMG incidence and control of ocular symptoms. Generally patients with diplopia were recommended for prednisone therapy. Most remained on daily 2.510 mg for diplopia control. We compared the results for prednisone-treated and untreated pyridostigmine only patients. Of 87 patients 55 were in the prednisone-treated and 32 were in the untreated groups. GMG developed in 7 13% of the prednisone-treated OR 0.41 95% CI 0.220.76 and in 16 50% of the untreated OR 2.78 95% CI 1.684.60 patients. After OMG onset GMG developed at a mean 5.8 and 0.22 years in prednisone and untreated groups.\n",

Review articles on OMG have questioned whether in prior studies case selection of patients with extended symptom duration and disease burden limited to OMG prior to initiating therapy may have biased the results resulting in too large a benefit of corticosteroid treatment in decreasing the incidence of generalized myasthenia gravis GMG 1214. In addition some authors have questioned whether corticosteroids truly reduce development of GMG or merely delay the onset of deterioration and whether control of diplopia relative to the systemic side effects is warranted 13 15 16. The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether the incidence of developing generalized myasthenia after presentation as OMG can be reduced by treatment with lowdose prednisone therapy after a moderate dose regimen tapered over 1012 weeks or whether this therapy merely postpones conversion to GMG. The secondary purpose is to determine the frequency with which the OMG symptoms and ptosis and ocular muscle limitation are controlled in prednisone-treated patients at a minimum of 4-year followup. We also examined the course and treatment of the cases where OMG was uncontrolled by prednisone.\n",

In the treated group pyridostigmine was used indoses aimed at alleviating residual or recurrent diplopia. Untreated patients received pyridostigmine using the maximum tolerated daily divided doses in an attempt to alleviate ptosis and diplopia. In general untreated patients were treated with higher daily doses of pyridostigmine.All of the patients were questioned and examined at each evaluation by MJK for the presence of GMG and any corticosteroid complications during the previous period. At each visit patients were probed for symptoms of fatigue change in activity due to fatigue or weakness shortness of breath change in voice problems swallowing or weakness in daily activities or exercise. The strengths of facial jaw and neck flexion and extension and the extremities with particular attention paid to the proximal muscle groups were evaluated at each visit.\n",

Though mycophenolate mofetil appears to be a good adjunctive therapy for GMG published reports on controlling OMG or reducing deterioration to GMG have been lacking 23 24. Only one study has been published using mycophenolate in OMG patientsand this was done in combination with prednisone 25. Of 27 patients who remained on the mycophenolate 93% did not develop GMG at 2 years so this regimen appears effective but the role of early treatment with prednisone may account for some of the benefit.Although the current study was not designed to address the role of thymectomy in OMG the two patients with thymoma underwent surgical resection without benefit with respect to the OMG. One patient required prednisone developing OMG findings 3 years after thymectomy and the other had persistent ophthalmoparesis and diplopia despite surgery and later failed prednisone and azathioprine therapy.\n",

The effect of prednisone on the progression from ocular to generalized myasthenia gravis. Fifty percent of ocular myasthenia gravis OMG patients will progress to generalized myasthenia 90% within 3 years from the onset of ocular symptoms. This study was performed to determine whether treatment with oral prednisone initiated and completed within 2 years from the onset of ocular symptoms would affect the progression of ocular myasthenia to generalized myasthenia gravis GMG. Fifty-six patients were included in this review with 27 patients in the prednisone-treated group and 29 patients in the untreated group. The treated group was initiated on 60 mg of prednisone daily with a slow taper over 36 months.\n",

        "paragraph": "In interpreting the significance of our findings one needs to consider the mechanism by which prednisone decreases the progression from OMG to GMG. While the exact action of prednisone as an immunomodulating agent is not known it is possible that corticosteroids may delay the onset of GMG without altering the underlying immunopathology. The majority of patients with myasthenia gravis require ongoing immunosuppression with either corticosteroids or other medications that suppress the immune system. This suggests that prednisone may not permanently change the immune system but may well play an important role early in the disease course which may prevent the patient from developing GMG. Further study of the actions of corticosteroids may help to clarify this issue in the future.Selection bias is a potential problem in any retrospective study. We found in our untreated patients who served as internal controls that 34% went on to develop generalized myasthenia gravis at 2 years which is in agreement with 41% as reported in the literature 1.The decision to use steroids in the treatment of ocular myasthenia gravis is controversial 14.\n",

Vitamin D has been shown to exert a multitude of effects on the autoimmune systems and its deficiency is increasingly associated with a wide range of immune-mediated disorders. However there are few studies about association of vitamin D in autoimmune neuromuscular disorders. MG is a prototypic autoimmune disease and autoantibodies to the AChR are present in approximately 80% of patients. Various peripheral immunomodulatory mechanisms including suppression of autoreactive clones by regulatory T cells Treg normally eliminate autoreactive cells. Treg is essential for self-tolerance and defects in Treg can cause experimental autoimmunity 8. Functional defects of Treg have been reported inin patients with myasthenia gravis. J Clin Neurosci 2018 https//doi.org/patients with autoimmune disorders 910. The immuneregulatory effect of vitamin D is mediated by increasing the amount of Treg populations. Vitamin D also had the capacity to inhibit T-cell proliferation 1112. Experimental studies have demonstrated the administration of nave CD4CD25 Treg to AChR-immunized animals prevents experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis 13.\n",

The retrieved data focused on documented date presumed cause and severity of exacerbation along with subsequent ED visit hospital admission and admission duration.Immunization records were acquired from EMR documentation which included a record of nurse-administered vaccinations or patient account of outside vaccination. Our cohort of patients was analyzed between 2011 and 2016 therefore pneumococcal pneumonia vaccinations were accounted for from 2006 onward. The vaccinations of interest for vaccine preventable infections VPI were seasonal influenza and pneumococcal vaccines PCV13 and PPSV23. Development of an acute MG exacerbation associated with VPI was defined by the presence of VPI at the time of ED visit/ hospitalization. Diagnosis ofVPI was established by documented laboratory tests including microbiology assessment blood/sputum cultures or imaging that supported diagnosis of seasonal influenza or pneumonia.\n",

Therefore the additional immunotherapies such as those with steroids are anyways required in many MG patients after thymectomy. The same fact was recognized even in our study.A limitation of this study was that we compared a little different time periods of the two groups. Because results of treatment generally improve with time by various causes this factor might influence results of our study. However significant effect of preoperative programmed high-dose steroid treatment was remarkable high as an independent predictor of the modified PR in MG patients after thymectomy in the multivariate analysis Cox regression analysis   0.008. Thus taking this thing together with our other previously mentioned data and previous reports we considered that the result had sufficient reliability.The autoimmune nature of the disease underlies the rationale for using steroids considering that the beneficial effects of this group of drugs have been observed in other autoimmune diseases. The mechanisms of action of steroids in MG patients are poorly understood.\n",

The results from this study showed that thymomatous MG was a risk factor for the modified PR. Although themechanisms underlying the effects of thymoma on MG remain unclear several possibilities exist. For example thymoma is more common among older patients so that MG may be relatively more severe in patients with thymoma 11.

Treatment was discontinued again with improvement in the patients symptoms within 2 days. Use of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated a probable relationship between the patients development of depression and mycophenolate mofetil therapy. Future evaluations of mycophenolate mofetil should include an assessment of psychological adverse effects. In addition postmarketing surveillance should be encouraged to further delineate the association between depression and mycophenolate mofetil therapy. Depressive Disorder Associated with Mycophenolate MofetilHeather M. Draper Pharm.D.Immunosuppressive pharmacologic agents are associated with a diverse array of adverse drug reactions. One of these agents mycophenolate mofetil is indicated for prevention of allogeneic organ transplant rejection and has recently been evaluated for treatment of autoimmune disease states including myasthenia gravis. Although the prescribing information for mycophenolate mofetil reports depression as an adverse event no descriptions of the onset or manifestation of this idiosyncratic reaction have been published.\n",

Discussion. Reports indicate that the lifetime incidence of depression in patients with myasthenia gravis is 3342% which is similar to that in patients with other chronic illnesses including other neurologic or neuromuscular diseases.7 8 Depression in patients with myasthenia gravis is thought to be associated with the onset of symptoms the diagnosis of the disease and possibly with disease exacerbations.8 A potential difficulty arises in the diagnosis of depression in patients with myasthenia gravis many o. f the tools used to diagnose depression assess symptoms and manifestations common to both depression and myasthenia gravis.\n",

        "paragraph": "A maintenance dose of prednisolone for myasthenia gravis could not shrink the size of the disseminated thymoma but prednisolone N30 mg daily succeeded in reducing the size of the tumor. Moreover a combination with tacrolimus enabled the daily dose of prednisolone to be tapered off without recurrence of myasthenia gravis and the disseminated thymoma almost disappeared. A moderate or higher dosage of corticosteroids with tacrolimus may in some cases be an effective procedure for pleural dissemination of thymoma. Treatment should be undertaken on a trial basis for patients not indicated for surgery radiotherapy or chemotherapy. 2006 European Federation of Internal Medicine. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. We present the case of an elderly woman with myasthenia gravis who had pleural dissemination of thymoma reduced by treatments with a moderate dose of corticosteroids and a conventional dose of tacrolimus. A maintenance dose of prednisolone for myasthenia gravis could not shrink the size of the disseminated thymoma but prednisolone N30 mg daily succeeded in reducing the size of the tumor.\n",

Both the treatment and control groups had methylprednisolone pulse therapy 1520mg/kg which was gradually tapered and oral administration of pyridostigmine bromide an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. If patients were already taking methylprednisolone or similar drugs the drugs would be withheld for 48 hours before this treatment. The treatment group also had 250mL Shenqi Fuzheng Injection intravenously once daily with the treatment course lasting for 20 days for both groups. The clinical absolute and relative scoring system was used to evaluate the treatment effect during the steroids pulse therapy Table 2 12. The clinical absolute score system evaluates the patients in the following eight aspects ptosis upper eyelid fatigue eyeball horizontal movement upper limbs fatigue lower limb fatigue facial muscles chewing and swallowing functions and respiratory muscle function 12. The clinical absolute scores ranges 064 with 0 being the least severe or normal while 64 is being the most severe.The clinical relative score is equal to pretreatment clinical absolute score posttreatment clinical absolute score/pretreatment clinical absolute score.\n",
