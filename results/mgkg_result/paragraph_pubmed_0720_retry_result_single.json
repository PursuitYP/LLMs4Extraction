    "paragraph": "Introduction. Central serous chorioretinopathy CSCR is a condition characterized by the accumulation of subretinal fluid at the posterior pole of the fundus causing single or multiple areas of serous retinal detachment. The pathophysiology of the disease is thought to involve retinal pigment epithelial RPE dysfunction increased leakage of choriocapillaris vessels and Bruchs membrane dysfunction 1 2. The result of localized exudation is the formation of retinal edema and small RPE detachments at the macular and perimacular areas. Although the aetiology and triggering factors of CSCR are not clearly understood the condition is commonly associated with the use of systemic or topical steroids 2 3. Consequently a critical therapeutic step is the withdrawal of any steroids the patient might be using.Case Rep Ophthalmol 2013416DOI 10.1159/000351856 2013 S. Karger AG Basel www.karger.com/copStefaniotou et al. Multifocal Central Serous Chorioretinopathy Associated with Steroids in a Patient with Myasthenia Gravis2Unfortunately when steroids are indispensable for the treatment of a patients systemic disease the management of CSCR becomes challenging. Here we report our experience in such a clinical setting. Case Report.\n",

Indocyanine green angiography excluded neovascularization and polyp-like vascular abnormalities. Low-fluence photodynamic therapy PDT was performed. We administered verteporfin i.v. at a dose of 6 mg/m2 over 10 min waited for 5 min and then directed the diode laser at the larger lesion of leakage in OD using a wavelength of 689 nm and laser energy of 25 mJ/cm2. After the first application the laser spot was directed at the second and the third lesion of leakage in OD fig. 3a end. As the patients myasthenic symptoms improved it became possible for the attending neurologist to reduce the dose of prednisolone increase the dose of azathioprine and add neostigmine. One month later and while undergoing prednisolone tapering his BCVA in OD had improved to 6/10 with no subretinal fluid while the area with the fibrin deposition had nearly disappeared fig. 3b end. The BCVA in OS improved to 10/10 over the next couple of months. To date 1 year after treatment the patients BCVA remains stable at 6/10 in OD and 10/10 in OS with no signs of active disease. The patients myasthenia is currently well controlled with azathioprine and neostigmine.\n",

Since lymphocytes exclusively use the de novo pathway whereas other cells use both pathways the drug selectively inhibits proliferation of T and B lymphocytes and has been used safely and effectively in managing patients with renal transplants. The first case report suggesting efficacy of mycophenolate as an immunosuppressive agent in myasthenia gravis appeared in 1998.1 This was followed by uncontrolled case series2-4 one small double-blind controlled trial5 and a Cochrane review.6 These studies and conversations among neurologists treating myasthenia popularized use of the drug.\n",

Rowland MDNeurology 200871390391Mycophenolate mofetil inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase a key enzyme in the de novo but not the salvage pathway of purine synthesis. Since lymphocytes exclusively use the de novo pathway whereas other cells use both pathways the drug selectively inhibits proliferation of T and B lymphocytes and has been used safely and effectively in managing patients with renal transplants. The first case report suggesting efficacy of mycophenolate as an immunosuppressive agent in myasthenia gravis appeared in 1998.1 This was followed by uncontrolled case series2-4 one small double-blind controlled trial5 and a Cochrane review.6 These studies and conversations among neurologists treating myasthenia popularized use of the drug. Until now however there have not been any adequately powered controlled trials.78In the Muscle Study Group MSG trial8 reported in this issue patients with myasthenia who were taking no other immunosuppressive therapy were randomized to receive either mycophenolate plus prednisone 20 mg/day or placebo plus prednisone 20 mg/day with the dose of prednisone remaining constant throughout the study.\n",

In fact improvement was seen in a remarkable 77% of patients in the placebo group.8 This figure raises concern that something is amiss a problem may have resulted because both the mycophenolate and placebo groups were also taking prednisone.\n",

However in practice patients with severe MG would be treated first with some combination of steroids IVIg and plasmapheresis and would also likely receive a steroid-sparing agent perhaps azathioprine or mycophenolate in anticipation of the need for more long-term immunosuppression. In effect the MSG study was designed to exclude the patients who might have been those most likely to benefit from treatment with mycophenolate.Notwithstanding the limitations of these trials the authors are to be congratulated for undertaking and completing two complicated trials in a rare dis-ease within a relatively short time. From these data we can conclude that in patients who have not yet proven to be steroid-resistant mycophenolate offers no advantage over modest-dose 20 mg/day prednisone for the short term 12 weeks and in patients taking 20 mg/day of prednisone treatment with mycophenolate for 9 months offers no benefit with respect to improvement in either myasthenic symptoms or lowering the dose of steroids.\n",

    "paragraph": "Japanese researchers previously investigated the association between Tac concentration and its clinical efficacy in the treatment of MG 7. They verified that more patients receiving an adequate Tac concentration achieved Bminimal manifestation or better status compared with patients with a lower concentration. Given the limited research on the Tac pharmacodynamic pathways it is important to consider the association among the pharmacodynamics of Tac and drug response for individualized medicine.As a calcineurin inhibitor Tac suppresses the dephosphorylation of NFAT by binding to FKBP1A after entering T cells 8 leading to suppression of IL-2 transcription 9 and immunosuppression of the development of autoimmune diseases 10. The IL-2 gene polymorphisms were reported to be associated with the development of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis 11 psoriasis 12 and acquired aplastic anemia 13. However there are no studies examining the influence of IL-2 gene polymorphisms on Tac clinical outcomes in MG patients.Because of the roles of IL-2 in Tac pharmacodynamics we postulated that the polymorphisms of this gene influence Tac clinical efficacy in MG patients. Therefore we investigated the relationship between the polymorphisms of IL-2 and Tac response in MG patients.\n",

    "paragraph": "In the present study we observed that the patients with the rs2069762 variant tended to be Tac ineffective. Those with the G/Tand G/G genotype in rs2069762 were also more likely to be Tac ineffective. One haplotype TAGG containing this mutation was identified among the Tac effective patients compared with the Tac ineffective patients indicating the association of rs2069762 with a Tac nonresponse. To our knowledge there is no validation for the direct association of the IL2 gene with the Tac response pathway. Previous researchers have revealed that the rs2069762 T>Gmutation located in the 5 flanking region of IL-2 could affect gene transcriptional regulation and further influence the function or expression of IL-2 in multiple sclerosis 11 and acquired aplastic anemia13. Therefore we infer that the rs2069762 mutation in a location where the IL-2 gene binds to transcription factors might offer a mechanism for Tac clinical efficacy. Thus it is necessary to validate the association of this mutation with the Tac response.\n",

Custom-designed prednisonesteroid use and MG survey was sent out to MG registry participants as part of semi-annual follow-up. Data were collected and analyzed for frequency. Results A total of 398 MG participants 21% response rate completed the survey including 173 men and 225 women. Among them 298 reported current 174 or past 288 prednisone intake. Current prednisone dosage varied from 0.5 to 75 mg median 10 mg IQR 720 dosing frequency was daily in 132 76% and every other day in 31 18%. Peak prednisone dose was commonly between 25 mg and 60 mg Median 50 mg IQR 2560 however doses more than 60 mg daily were reported in 59 20%. Prednisone AEs were reported more commonly in women 95% vs 81% p < 0.0001. Women reported more intolerable AEs 77% vs 50% p < 0.00001 and less willingness to accept a dose increase 26% vs 44% p  0.03 compared with men. Conclusions Prednisone is commonly used in the treatment of MG with highly variable dosages and dosing frequencies reflecting the absence of a standard guideline. Intolerable AEs were more commonly reported among women and was associated with unwillingness to accept a dose increase.\n",

The 33 items included in the AEs list were derived from MGTX treatment-associated symptoms and treatment-associated complications. Participants were asked to select AEs they experienced from taking steroid prednisone and select them once more if any of them were difficult to tolerate appendix e-1 links.lww.com/NXI/A77. This survey was sent to the MG registry participants along with the semi-annual followup for those who enrolled before April 15 2017.

    "paragraph": "The efficacy of the corticosteroid medications such as prednisone rely on its pleiotropic effects on the glucocorticoid receptors through multiple signaling pathways which inevitably evoke physiologic signaling along with its anti-inflammatory effect. Women in this study not only reported AEs more commonly but also perceived them as more intolerable compared with men. Consistent with this result women more frequently reported that the dosage of prednisone had to be lowered because of AEs. Experiencing intolerable AEs was associated with a tendency to be resistant to a possible future dose increase if needed for an MG exacerbation and this was more common in women. A previous study that looked at symptom experience associated with chronic immunosuppressive treatment in heart transplant recipients and the result showed that clear gender difference exists. In the study women reported adverse symptomsmore frequently with a higher distress level and the pattern of symptoms was different from men. Women also experienced more AEs in the MG patient registry the MG population treated with long-term steroids. There are many potential factors that might explain this observation. Physiologically women have lower height and weight compared with men.\n",

    "paragraph": "That is not what we observed in our case. Therefore the diagnosis of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis seems very unlikely.Myasthenia is also an autoimmune disease causing weakness of striated muscles. The antibodies acetylcholine receptor antibodies target the neuromuscular junction causing accelerated degradation of acetylcholine receptors and inducing a functional acetylcholine receptor block. Moreover the complement activation induced by acetylcholine receptor antibodies may be the primary cause of neuromuscular transmission failure. Other antibodies may also be involved 11.In our case the patients weakness was initially attributed to thyrotoxicosis as suggested by the raised serum creatine kinase value before the convulsions. Nevertheless the finding of normal concentrations of thyroid hormones strongly suggestive clinical and electrophysiological data the dramatic effect of the neostigmine injection and the high concentration of circulating acetylcholine receptor antibodies led us to a second diagnosis of associated myasthenia gravis 12.The association of Graves disease with myasthenia gravis was first described in 1908 13. Since then this association has often been reported 1417. Of note up to 17.5% of known myasthenic patients were found to have hyperthyroidism 2.\n",

It is of utmost importance to exclude myasthenia gravis in patients with hyperthyroidism who have neuromuscular symptoms. Mycophenolate mofetil for myasthenia gravis a clear and present controversy. Correspondence Chad Heatwole Department of Neurology The University of Rochester Rochester New York USA Email chadheatwoleurmc.rochester.edu Abstract Mycophenolate mofetil MMF has been used to treat myasthenia gravis MG for over 10 years. MMFs use in the MG population stems from its theoretical mechanism of action and the medical literature that supports its benefi t in MG patients. Recently two large double-blinded placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials were initiated to study the effectiveness of MMF for MG. One of these studies found no benefi t in taking MMF with 20 mg of prednisone as compared to taking prednisone alone while the other study demonstrated no advantage in taking MMF against placebo during a 36-week prednisone taper. This article critically reviews the medical literature on MMFs use in MG and suggests further research avenues on this topic. 2008 Dove Medical Press Limited.\n",

Two of 3 patients who switched to MMF experienced no neurological worsening of their MG with marked improvement of renal function once off cyclosporine. A third patient experienced improved renal function but had one signifi cant myasthenia exacerbation during MMF use Lim et al 2007.MM has also been studied in patients with purely ocular symptoms ocular MG Chan 2008. In a prospective observational study 31 patients with ocular MG and positive AChRNeuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment 200846 1207Ab were identifi ed and evaluated.\n",

    "paragraph": "Once ocular symptoms resolved each patients prednisone dose was tapered over a four week span. Researchers found that 87% 27/31 patients were able to tolerate the MMF. Of this group 93% 25/27 remained at MGFA class I for an average observation period of 4.2 years. Although there was no direct comparison group in this study the rate of decompensation to generalized myasthenia was thought to be equal or lower than ocular myasthenia patients taking azathioprine and/or corticosteroids compared with a separate retrospective study Sommer et al 1997 Chan 2008. Of the 4 patients who discontinued MMF during Chans study 3 cited persistent diarrhea while 1 discontinued the medication secondary to cost.After much anticipation in 2008 the results of 2 large scale double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials were published which tested the effi cacy of MMF in MG Sanders et al 2008 The Muscle Study Group 2008. The relatively surprising fi ndings from these studies have caused much discussion and deliberation in the neuromuscular community.The fi rst of these studies was implemented by the Muscle Study Group MSG and was designed to compare the use of MMF in combination with prednisone 20 mg/day versus prednisone 20 mg/day alone for generalized MG The Muscle Study Group 2008.\n",

    "paragraph": "Discussion. The collection of past research on MMFs role in MG treatment is neither exhaustive nor conclusive. Early reports and studies appear to hint at MMFs effi cacy while the latest placebo-controlled trials did not defi nitively prove its benefi t compared with placebo. Each of the above described articles is not without criticism. Early case reports are thought provoking but are subject to positive study bias. It is not known how many times MMF was previously used for MG without effect. Such failures are typically not submitted to or accepted by major publications. In addition signifi cantNeuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment 2008461208confounding factors exist in many of the early publications. Most patients in these studies had a history of prior or coexisting treatments including corticosteroid use azathioprine cyclosporine thymectomy IVIG pyridostigmine or full body radiation. In many cases these therapies were being used or withdrawn during the evaluation period of MMF thus complicating the interpretation of results. In cases where a therapy had been discontinued prior to MMF use it is possible that long term or even delayed effects could have been inappropriately attributed to MMF.\n",

    "paragraph": "In addition it is possible that the latest clinical trials did not evaluate the myasthenia patients that would have experienced the greatest benefi t from taking MMF. While the Muscle Study Groups trial was well planned carefully executed and adequately analyzed it only addressed the question of MMFs usefulness in a very small subpopulation of MG patients over a very specifi c and perhaps too short time frame in the context of both concurrent prednisone use and a specifi c and perhaps understudied primary endpoint. While some literature suggests the early effi cacy of MMF the retrospective study of 85 patients reported a maximal objective benefi t only at an average of 26.7 weeks Meriggioli et al 2003. It is possible that a separation in effi cacy wouldhave been demonstrated had the trial been carried out for a longer period of time. Also while quantifi able few would argue that the QMG score is the perfect measure of therapy effectiveness. The MSG study was powered to detect a difference of 3 points on the QMG score between the two arms. It is diffi cult to know for certain if this was the most appropriate clinical difference in which to base an outcome measure.Likewise there are similar limitations in the 2008 Sanders et al MMF clinical trial.\n",

We discuss the anesthetic management of two myasthenic patients undergoing emergency surgery for sigmoid perforation and upper gastrointestinal bleeding respectively. In both cases we opted for rapidsequence induction with high-dose rocuronium to prevent inhalation of gastric contents. We also report on the implication of neuromuscular monitoring.

In these patients the pharmacodynamics of succinylcholine are unpredictable as the effective dose in 95% of patients ED95 is increased up to 2.6 times and such resistance can cause prolonged onset time216 which is particularly undesirable in RSI.Nondepolarizing NMBA may show a large variability in duration of neuromuscular block but it is usually much prolonged longer even with the use of small doses.3Additionally the concomitant action of anticholinesterase therapy may reduce the effect of anti. cholinesterase used for reversal increasing the risk of cholinergic crisis.14517 It is therefore important to check for the presence of fade at TOF before the administration of any neuromuscular transmission affecting drugs because the need for nondepolarizing NMBA could be even lower than expected in such patients.18Data from the literature suggest that in most myasthenic individuals 0.51  ED95 of nondepolarizing NMBAs provides adequate neuromuscular block for laryngoscopy.1419 It is therefore . safe to conclude that routine dosage should be reduced by 5075% taking into account the possibility of fade before administration of neuromuscular transmission-interfering drugs e.g.\n",

Moreover the cases described a real-life setting we used an uncalibrated monitoring and we only recorded the absence of fade before NMBA administration without determining the exact initial value of TOF ratio and we decided to include a period of close observation in an intensive setting even if data on neuromuscular function were suggesting complete recovery.Onset time of nondepolarizing NMBA is ultimately a pharmacokinetic process and depends upon the speed at which molecules reach the biophas. e which in turn depends on the gradient between blood and the biophase. Our decision to administer full dose of rocuronium 11.2 mg/kg was based on these considerations as well as on published literature24 aiming at rapid airway control this important safety issue could have not been achieved with succinylcholine to which myasthenics may prove resistant.2 In both cases we decided to avoid induction without muscle relaxants partly because of the higher risks of poor tracheal intubation conditions and also especially in the second case because of the risk of adverse he.\n",

    "paragraph": "There are proponents and opponents of these various forms of therapy but the studies evaluating the efficacy of these treatment options are of limited quality. There are no randomized controlled trials or data from observational studies that address the question of the efficacy of treatments of ocular symptoms.1 In the absence of evidence approaches to the treatment of ocular symptoms in myasthenia vary greatly.2-5 There is probably little disagreement that it is appropriate to initiate therapy with pyridostigmine but the magnitude of clinical benefit that might be expected and the frequency with which symptoms may resolve completely are unknown.

The beginning of a treatment epoch was defined by the time at which follow-up on the relevant medication began. The end of a pyridostigmine treatment period was defined by the remission of symptoms the discontinuation of pyridostigmine the addition of prednisone to the treatment regimen or the end of follow-up. The end of a steroid treatment period was defined by remission of symptoms discontinuation of prednisone or end of follow-up.Because the therapeutic strategy of the treating neurologist involved the initial use of pyridostigmine followed by steroids if required by symptoms and then a steroid taper once remission was achieved we considered only periods of treatment with pyridostigmine that preceded periods of treatment with steroids. The analytic approach that we have used focuses on treatment epochs rather than patient treatment groups for several reasons. Some patients contributed an epoch of treatment on both pyridostigmine alone and then on prednisone.\n",

Although a matched analysis comparing each patients two treatment epochs would have been more ideal given the small number of patients n 6 for whom data on both epochs were available we opted for an unmatched analysis comparing treatment epochs rather than participants. The Wilcoxon rank sum test and Fisher exact test were used for the comparison of ocular-QMG scores and remission rates regression analyses were performed as needed to adjust for follow-up duration. We also examined time to remission by survival analysis. The level of statistical significance was set at 0.05 two-sided.RESULTS Study population.

MG patients admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine between June 2011 and January 2017 aged between 18 and 70 with grade III and grade IV according to the modified Osserman scale were recruited and received a telephone follow-up in September 2017. Our department is a well-known tertiary referral center for MG. Patients clinical and laboratory data were collected retrospectively. Diagnosis of MG was based on their history clinical symptoms positive outcomes of pharmacological and electrophysiological tests and antibody tests 7. Diagnosis of MG was confirmed by assessing serum AChR-Ab titers in most cases. Patients with elevated levels of liver enzymes renal insufficiency impaired glucose tolerance malignant tumor severe infection patients undergoing thymectomy within one year pregnant and lactating women at baseline were excluded. All subjects were contacted and received information about the aim of this study and written consents were obtained. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine. 2.2 end. Treatment. Patients were divided into two groups.\n",

    "paragraph": "Therefore patients treated with tacrolimus more likely had severe or refractory symptoms than those with traditional immunosuppressive agents. Additionally Ponseti and colleagues reported that post-thymectomy administration of tacrolimus combined with prednisone was more effective than prednisone alone for the consolidation of complete stable remission in a shorter period of time in MG patients which proved the ability of tacrolimus in improving clinical symptoms of thymectomized MG patients 36. The other reason is that patients who underwent thymectomy had a significantly lowerMG-ADL score than patients without thymectomy in the control group. Consistent with an international randomized trial conducted by Wolfe and colleagues showed that patients who underwent thymectomy combined with prednisone had a lower quantitative myasthenia gravis score over a 3-year period than those who received prednisone alone 37. In summary although there were more patients underwent thymectomy in the tacrolimus group the two-way ANOVA still showed patients treated with tacrolimus had more favorable outcomes in improving MG-ADL score and reducing the number of hospital admission.Tacrolimus treatment showed the positive effect of improving MGADL score in MG patients.\n",

    "paragraph": "Objective To elucidate the long-term therapeutic efficacy and safety of low-dose FK506 tacrolimus in patients with myasthenia gravis MG. Patients and methods We treated nine patients with MG all women age range 3583years mean 51.1years MGFA classification 4 type IIa 4 type IIb and 1 type IVb patients with FK506 for more than 24months observation period 2446months. All the patients had undergone extended thymectomy before FK506 treatment two patients 22.2% had noninvasive thymoma and six 66.7% had thymic hyperplasia. We evaluated total Quantitative MG Q-MG score anti-acetylcholine receptor AChR antibody titer in the blood interleukin 2 IL-2 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs administration dosage of prednisolone PSL and adverse effects of FK506. Results A reduction in steroid dosage of 50% without worsening of the symptoms was observed 1year after FK506 administration in three out of six steroid-dependent MG patients 50.0%. The total Q-MG scores range 039 points at 6months and 1year after FK506 administration improved by 3 points or more in six 66.7% and seven 77.8% out of nine patients respectively. The efficacy of FK506 was maintained for more than 2years. Although adverse effects were observed in three patients 33.3% these were not serious.\n",
