A further   understanding of the origin of cherts is helpful to clarify Early Carboniferous oceanic and depositional condi-  tions. However, the origin of the Lower Carboniferous cherts remains controversial. The Dawuba cherts are rich   in sponge spicules (monaxons and triaxon hexactines), radiolarians, and foraminifera (Endothyracea) and can be   lithologically divided into the Manchang spicule-bearing chert (MSC), Manchang foraminifera-bearing chert   (MFC), Getuhe radiolarian-bearing chert (GRC), and Luogang foraminifera-bearing chert (LFC). The analytical   results of redox-sensitive trace elements (Mo, U) covariation pattern and microfossils types indicate that the   Dawuba cherts formed in a suboxic–euxinic deep-water environment with some contributions of intermittent   calcareous allochthonous sediments from the platform and slope. According to microfossils, Fe/Ti values, Post-   Archean Australian Shale normalized rare earth element + Y patterns, Eu anomalies versus Y/Ho cross plot,   silicon isotopes (δ30Si), and oxygen isotopes (δ18O), the Dawuba cherts have biogenic, hydrothermal, and   hydrogenetic origins, and the MFCs and LFCs are also characterized by replacement cherts. The silica of Dawuba   cherts was mainly sourced from siliceous organisms, hydrothermal fluids, and seawater, followed by river water.   The silica diagenesis underwent a sequence of opal-A → opal-CT → quartz via dissolution–precipitation reaction   or in-situ replacement without intermediary dissolution steps. Siliceous ooze underwent diagenesis to form   biogenic cherts. Silica from hydrothermal fluids, seawater, and river water chemically precipitated to form   hydrothermal and hydrogenetic cherts. Silica-rich solutions silicified the calcareous allochthonous sediments to   form replacement cherts. Flourishing of siliceous organisms, mixing of hydrothermal, seawater-dissolved, and   riverine-dissolved silica, and intermittent transport of calcareous allochthonous sediments, played important   roles in the deposition and development of cherts in the trough basin during the Early Carboniferous.      1. Introduction     The Early Carboniferous was an important interval for the transition   from the mid-Paleozoic greenhouse climate to the Late Paleozoic Ice   Age, and there were two short glaciation events in the mid-Tournaisian   and Visean stages (Lakin et al., 2016  Liu et al., 2019  Qie et al., 2019),   and the short-lived glacial pulses were consistent with the frequent   global sea-level changes (Kaiser et al., 2011). During the Carboniferous   Period, the global tectonic movement was intense, and the Youjiang   Basin experienced strong rifting (Wang et al., 2019  Wang et al., 2020).     Marine organisms such as radiolarians, echinoderms, foraminifera,   brachiopods, and conodonts flourished (Wang et al., 2019). The cherts   formed under the conditions of severe climate change, strong tectonic   activity, and relatively high siliceous productivity have obvious partic-  ularities. The mechanisms related to the formation of these cherts   require further study.   Because chert has strong resistance to weathering and alteration, its   geochemical characteristics record the incorporation of terrigenous   detritus, hydrothermal precipitates, and volcanic clasts, so it is impor-  tant to understand the sedimentary environment during their formation     * Corresponding author at: School of Energy Resources, China University of Geosciences (Beijing), Beijing 100083, China.

(B) Geological   overview of Ziyun area, modified from Dai et al. (2009).     (Kato and Nakamura, 2003). Furthermore, understanding the origin of   cherts is of great significance in paleo-oceanic and paleo-geographic   reconstructions (Gao et al., 2020a). Chert may originate from terrige-  nous, biogenic, hydrothermal, and volcanic sources, or it may serve as a   replacement mineral (Knauth, 1979  Hesse, 1988). The cherts are   generally developed in the Lower Carboniferous strata in Guizhou and   Guangxi, but the origin of cherts remains controversial. The Lower   Carboniferous siliceous sediments in the Shuicheng–Ziyun–Nandan rift   trough basin have both hydrothermal and non-hydrothermal origins   (Huang et al., 2012). The Upper Devonian–Lower Carboniferous cherts   in the Badu area, western Guangxi, have a non-hydrothermal origin   (Huang et al., 2013). The Upper Devonian–Lower Carboniferous radio-  larian cherts, which coexist with basalts in the Baise area of western   Guangxi, were affected by submarine volcanoes and hydrothermal ac-  tivities, whereas the Upper Devonian–Middle Permian strata indicates   the continuous deposition of biogenic radiolarian cherts in the Qinzhou   area, Southern Guangxi (Wang et al., 1995).   In this study, petrological and geochemical analyses were conducted   on the cherts of the Dawuba Formation in the Ziyun area, including   polarizing microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, major, trace and   rare earth elements, and silicon and oxygen isotopes. This study aims to   clarify the depositional environment that governed the formation of the   cherts, determine the origins of cherts, establish a diagenetic model for   the Dawuba cherts in the study area, and provide a basis for clarifying   the formation mechanism of cherts in the trough basin under the com-  plex background of frequent eustatic changes, strong rifting, and high   siliceous productivity.     2. Geological setting     The Youjiang Basin is located in the western part of the South China   Craton. From the Devonian to Carboniferous, during the Paleo-Tethyan   expansion, the Youjiang Basin experienced rifting and the development   of a passive continental margin (Wang et al., 2020), forming a palae-  ogeographical pattern of alternating distributions of platforms and   trough basins (Du et al., 2013). The Shuicheng–Ziyun–Nandan Fault   Zone in southern Guizhou acts as the boundary for the northern margin     of the Youjiang Basin, and the Shuicheng–Ziyun–Nandan rift trough   basin formed along the fault zone (Huang et al., 2013  Tao et al., 2015).   The trough basin is a long, narrow northwest-southeast trending trough,   which began to form in the Early Devonian and rifting intensified in the   Middle Devonian (Wang et al., 2006). The strong extensional movement   formed broken zones, which provided channels for deep hydrothermal   fluids (Gao et al., 2012  Gao et al., 2013). The hydrothermal fluids were   deposited in the trough basin, forming the Leji barite deposit of the   Upper Devonian Xiangshuidong Formation (Wang et al., 2006  Tao   et al., 2015  Gao et al., 2017).   In the Early Devonian, seawater intruded into the trough basin from   southeast to northwest, forming a set of limestone–mudstone–chert   sedimentary assemblage (Wang et al., 2006). From late Middle Devo-  nian to early Late Devonian, the range of transgression was the largest,   forming chert– siliceous mudstone assemblage (Wang et al., 2006). The   range of transgression slightly contracted in the early Early Carbonif-  erous, and the transgression occurred again in the middle Early   Carboniferous, which resulted in the parallel unconformity of the   Datangian strata on the strata of different ages, forming a set of sha-  le–chert–limestone sedimentary assemblages (Guizhou Geological Sur-  vey Institute, 2017) (Fig. 1A). The Lower Carboniferous Dawuba   Formation is a set of Datangian slope-basin facies shales intercalated   with chert and limestone, above the limestone of the Muhua Formation   and below the limestone of the Nandan and Weining formations, and it is   present mainly in the Luodian, Wangmo, and Ziyun areas (Guizhou   Geological Survey Institute, 2017).   The cherts of the Dawuba Formation in the Ziyun area are mainly   thin- to medium-bedded cherts that developed in, or rhythmically   interbedded with, shales. The cherts are rich in sponge spicules, radio-  larians, and foraminifera. The microfossils in the cherts vary from one   outcrop to another and among different locations in the same outcrop. In   this study, Manchang, Getuhe, and Luogang sections in the Ziyun area   were selected for investigation (Fig. 1B). The Manchang section   (25.69847◦N, 106.08623◦E) is located along the road near Manchang,   Ziyun County. The Dawuba Formation is well exposed. It is underlain by   the limestone of the Muhua Formation and overlain by the limestone of   the Nandan Formation.

There are several thin- to medium-bedded cherts in the sec-  tion, with thicknesses ranging from several centimeters to tens of cen-  timeters (Fig. 3A–D). The Getuhe section (25.65736◦N, 106.246981◦E)   is located along the road near Getuhe scenic spot, Ziyun County. The   lower part of the Dawuba Formation is well exposed, but the upper part   is poor. It is underlain by the limestone of the Muhua Formation and   overlain by the limestone of the Weining Formation. The cherts are   interbedded with shale in the Dawuba Formation (Fig. 2C). Cherts are   thin-bedded with thicknesses of several centimeters (Fig. 3 E, F). The   Luogang section (25.736039◦N, 105.99523◦E) is located along the road   near Luogang, Ziyun County. The lower part of the Dawuba Formation is   well exposed, but the upper part is poor. It is underlain by the limestone   of the Muhua Formation and overlain by the limestone of the Nandan   Formation. The lithology of the Dawuba Formation mainly consists of     shale intercalated with chert, siltstone, and limestone (Fig. 2D). There   are several medium-bedded cherts in the section with thicknesses of tens   of centimeters (Fig. 3G–I).     3. Methodology     A total of 13 chert samples were collected from the Dawuba For-  mation in the Ziyun area, including 9 samples from the Manchang sec-  tion, 2 from the Getuhe section, and 2 from the Luogang section (Fig. 2).   Polarizing microscopy was used for detailed petrographic examina-  tion to determine the mineralogy of the cherts. Scanning electron mi-  croscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS)   were used for small-scale observations and elemental abundance anal-  ysis. Block samples with fresh surfaces were coated with gold and   examined with a HITACHI SU8010 cold field-emission scanning electron     Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 590 (2022) 110863    3    \fY.

Operating conditions included accelerating voltages   of 0.1–30 kV and working distances of 1.5–30 mm under vacuum.   All 13 chert samples were selected for geochemical analysis. Samples   were cut to remove the surface weathering layer and visible veins. The   remaining samples were ground to a 200 mesh size for further analysis.   Major elements were determined at the Analytical Laboratory of   Beijing Research Institute of Uranium Geology (ALBRIUG) according to   published procedures for the analysis of silicate rocks (GB/T 14506.28-   2010, 2010  GB/T 14506.34-2019, 2019). Sample powders were melted   in a mixture of Li2B4O7 + LiF + NH4NO3 + LiBr at 1150–1250 ◦C. Then,   major element concentrations were analyzed by an Axios-mAX wave-  length dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer with analytical pre-  cision estimated to be better than 1%. Loss on ignition (LOI) was   determined by heating sample powders at 1000 ± 25 ◦C until achieving   a constant weight.   Trace and rare earth element (REE) concentrations were analyzed at   the ALBRIUG, using an ELEMENT XR inductively coupled plasma-mass   spectrometer (ICP-MS), according to accepted methods for the chemical   analysis of silicate rocks (GB/T 14506.30-2010, 2010). Sample powders   were digested in a mixture of HF + HNO3 in a Teflon container. Then,   the mixture solution was diluted with water for ICP-MS analysis. The   accuracy of the ICP-MS analyses was within 5 to 15%.   Enrichment factors (EF) were calculated as X-EF = [(X/Al)sample/(X/   Al)PAAS], where X and Al stand for the weight percent concentrations of   elements X and Al, respectively (Tribovillard et al., 2006  Algeo and   Tribovillard, 2009  Tribovillard et al., 2012). Samples were normalized   using the Post-Archean Australian Shale (PAAS) compositions (Taylor   and McLennan, 1985).   PAAS normalized REE + Y patterns are presented for each sample     (McLennan, 1989). Ce anomalies were calculated as Ce/Ce* = Cen/   (0.5Lan + 0.5Prn) (Bau and Dulski, 1996). Eu anomalies were calculated   as Eu/Eu* = Eun/[Smn × (Smn/Ndn)1/2] (Lawrence et al., 2006). Pr/Pr*   ratios were calculated according to Pr/Pr* = Prn/(0.5Cen + 0.5Ndn)   (Bau and Dulski, 1996). The enrichment of heavy REE compared to light   REE was assessed using the value of Lan/Ybn (Murray et al., 1991    Murray et al., 1992a  Murray et al., 1992b). In each of these formulas,   “n” represents the elemental concentrations normalized to PAAS values   (McLennan, 1989).   Silicon isotope compositions were determined at the ALBRIUG, using   a MAT-253 gas isotope mass spectrometer, following an accepted   method for determining silicon isotope composition (DZ/T 0184.22-   1997, 1997). Sample powders removed carbonate and organic carbon   via HCl dissolving and at 800 ◦C, respectively. The residual samples   were heated and reacted with BrF5 under vacuum conditions to form   SiF4. Then, the SiF4 was purified for silicon isotope composition deter-  mination. Using quartz sand from the National Bureau of Standards   (NBS-28) as the standard sample. The results are reported as δ30Si values   against NBS-28. The analytical precision was better than ± 0.1‰.   Although the widely used standard is NBS-28 in the measurement of   silicon isotope compositions (Ding et al., 1988), there are also re-  searchers using the Caltech Rose Quartz Standard (RQS) (Douthitt,   1982). The δ30Si value for RQS relative to NBS-28 is (cid:0) 0.28‰ (Molini-   Velsko et al., 1986  Ding et al., 1994  Andr´e et al., 2006).   Oxygen isotope compositions were analyzed at the ALBRIUG, using a   Delta v Advantage gas isotope mass spectrometer, according to the   method for determining oxygen isotope composition in silicate minerals   (DZ/T 0184.13-1997, 1997). Sample powders were heated and reacted   with pure BrF5 under vacuum conditions to release O2. Generated O2   was separated from SiF4 and BrF3 via freezing method.

Spicule-bearing chert     Thin- to medium-bedded spicule-bearing cherts are present in the     Manchang section. Using polarizing microscopy, we find that the Man-  chang spicule-bearing chert (hereinafter referred to as MSC) are formed   by the accumulation of sponge spicules (Fig. 4 A, C, H)  mainly mon-  axons with some triaxon hexactines. Chalcedony is the primary mineral   component of the spicules (Fig. 4B). The longitudinal sections of the   monaxons are columnar and acicular, and axial canals are visible (Fig. 4   A, B, D, G, I). The transverse sections of the monaxons are circular with   an inner cavity (Fig. 4 A, F). The triaxon hexactines are formed by three   axes that intersect vertically, whereof four needles intersect to form a   plane. The other two needles cross the plane at the point of intersection.

(For interpretation of the references   to colour in this figure legend, the reader is   referred to the web version of this article.)      The axial canal is visible at the intersection of the three axes. All needles   are gradually thin from the base to the point (Fig. 4 E, F). The distri-  bution of spicules in some cherts shows a weak directionality (Fig. 4H).   Except for individual spicules that have been abraded into short   columnar shapes (Fig. 4A), most are preserved intact. In some cherts, the   spicules are distributed with no specific orientation (Fig. 4C).   The biological structures of the sponge spicules can easily be   observed by SEM (Fig. 4 J–Q). Most of the spicules are monaxons,   mainly with a long columnar shape (Fig. 4 M, P). A few polyaxons are   also visible (Fig. 4O). The transverse sections of the spicules are circular     (Fig. 4 J–L), and the axial canal is visible (Fig. 4N). EDS analysis of the   sponge spicules yields the elements Si and O indicating only silica   (Fig. 4R). The mineral composition is cryptocrystalline quartz (< 5 μm,   Fig. 4 N, O, Q) and microcrystalline quartz (5–20 μm, Fig. 4M) (Scholle   and Ulmer-Scholle, 2003).   4.1.2.

GRC) is composed of radiolarians and groundmass (Fig. 5F). Radiolar-  ians are chiefly round or elliptical in appearance (Fig. 5 B, C, D, L, M). A   few radiolarians are petal-shaped with small spines arranged equidis-  tantly on the surface of the test (Fig. 5 E, J). A small number of radio-  larians are round with small spines on the surface (Fig. 5I). Although the   appearance of these radiolarians is similar to that of the petal-shaped   radiolarians, the small spines are of different lengths and disorderly   arrange. The radiolarian tests are composed of chalcedony, and the in-  teriors are filled with chalcedony and organic matter (Fig. 5 E, G, H, I,   K). Many radiolarians have interior chalcedony strips in herringbone,     dumbbell, and crescent patterns (Fig. 5 B, C, F). Several radiolarians   have multiple concentric tests (Fig. 5 D, L, M) with visible radial beams.   The tests and radial beams are composed of chalcedony. Some radio-  larians have well-preserved radial spines. The number of radial spines   varies from one (most common) to three (Fig. 5 F-H). A few radiolarian   tests have a grid-like structure with clearly visible holes (Fig. 5 M, N). In   addition, a handful of radiolarians have incomplete internal structures   and collapsed and deformed tests owing to dissolution and compaction   (Fig. 5A). The groundmass of the GRC is composed of cryptocrystalli-  ne–microcrystalline quartz, argillaceous materials, and organic matter.

Comparative analysis of major element oxides for the Dawuba cherts in the Ziyun area. The MSCs contain samples ZMC-8, ZMC-24, ZMC-33, ZMC-36, ZMC-   38, and ZMC-40. The MFCs contain samples ZMC-18, ZMC-41, and ZMC-42. The GRCs contain samples ZGTH-1 and ZGTH-2. The LFCs contain samples ZLG-3 and   ZLG-5.     Argillaceous material is an aggregate of mainly yellowish-brown clay   minerals. The organic matter is unevenly disseminated and is mainly   distributed as a black mass and laminae.   The SEM results show that the radiolarians have a circular structure   composed of multiple concentric tests (Fig. 5 O–Q). EDS analysis in-  dicates that the radiolarian tests are composed only of silica (Fig. 5R).   The mineral composition of the tests is cryptocrystalline quartz (<5 μm,   Fig. 5O). The original cavities between the concentric tests are filled   with cryptocrystalline quartz (Fig. 5P). Some radiolarians have intact   internal tests with a visible central medullary shell (Fig. 5Q).   4.1.3. Foraminifera-bearing chert   Medium-bedded foraminifera-bearing cherts are mainly found in the   Manchang and Luogang sections. Using polarizing microscopy, we find   that the Manchang foraminifera-bearing chert (hereinafter referred to as   MFC) and Luogang foraminifera-bearing chert (hereafter referred to as   LFC) have abundant foraminifera and a few sponge spicules (Fig. 6). The   foraminifera are almost completely silicified (Fig. 6 B, C) and the wall   and septum of the tests are replaced by fine-grained cryptocrystalline   chalcedony. A small amount of residual calcite that has not been   completely replaced by quartz is visible in the wall and septum. The   chambers are filled with fine-grained chalcedony. Most silicified     foraminifera retain their original intact test structure (Fig. 6 J, K). Ac-  cording to our observations, the Early Carboniferous foraminifera in the   Manchang and Luogang sections have calcareous micro granular walls   with one or two layers, and the septum does not have folds, indicating   that the foraminifera belong to Endothyrina. Moreover, the foraminifera   tests are composed of multiple planispiral chambers and can be further   classified as Endothyracea (Hao and Mao, 1993). We identify the   following foraminifera families: Archaediscidae (Fig. 6A), Endothyridae   (Fig. 6 D, J, L), and Tournayellidae (Fig. 6I). There are also some fora-  minifera belonging to Endothyracea (Fig. 6 B, E, G), but because of   randomly orientated sections or unclear test structures, further biolog-  ical identification is not possible. Sponge spicules, mainly monaxons,   can be seen in both the MFCs and LFCs. Some of them are well preserved   (Fig. 6 H, M), while some are broken (Fig. 6F) with clearly visible axial   canals.   The biological structures of the foraminifera are visible in the SEM   images (Fig. 6 N, P). Foraminifera are elliptical in appearance with   clearly visible walls, septums, and chambers (Fig. 6 N, P). EDS analysis   of the chamber fill and foraminifera wall both reveals the elements Si   and O, whereas the latter shows a minor amount of Ca (Fig. 6 O, R). The   mineral composition of the wall and septum is a plate-like aggregate of   microcrystalline quartz. The chamber fill is cryptocrystalline quartz     Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 590 (2022) 110863    8    \fY.

Major element abundances   The major elements for the Dawuba cherts in the Ziyun area are   presented in Table 1. The SiO2 concentrations range from 79.67 to 96.9   wt% (average: 90.73 wt%). LFCs have the highest SiO2 concentration   (Fig. 7). The Al2O3 concentrations are between 0.47 and 9.11 wt%   (average: 2.7 wt%). MSCs have the highest Al2O3 concentration. The   TFe2O3 concentrations vary from 0.53 to 5.99 wt% (average: 2.38 wt%)     with MSCs having the highest TFe2O3 concentration. The average con-  centrations of MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O, TiO2, and P2O5 for the Dawuba   chert are 0.31, 0.605, 0.142, 0.355, 0.15, and 0.03 wt%, respectively.   The MnO concentrations range from 0.004 to 0.02 wt% (average: 0.007   wt%), except for one sample that has a concentration below the method   detection limit. In general, the concentrations of MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O,   TiO2, P2O5, and MnO in the different cherts do not show obvious   changing trends (Fig. 7).   The Fe/Ti ratios of the Dawuba cherts are between 6.63 and 71.86   (average: 23.92). The Fe/Ti ratios of the MSCs range from 11.36 to   27.99, that of the MFCs range from 6.63 to 26.8, that of the GRCs vary     Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 590 (2022) 110863    9    \fY.

Trace and rare earth element abundances   The trace and rare earth element concentrations of the Dawuba   cherts are presented in Table 2. The concentrations of redox-sensitive   trace elements like U and Mo are 0.347–7.25 μg/g (average: 1.6 μg/   g), 0.152–57.2 μg/g (average: 7.7 μg/g), respectively. Mo–EFs and   U–EFs are 3.9–460 and 1.2–18.8, respectively. The MSCs show Mo–EFs   of 3.9–22.7 and U–EFs of 1.2–2.1. The MFCs exhibit Mo–EFs of   36.7–133.8 and U–EFs of 4.6–8.0. The GRCs show Mo–EFs of   137.9–460.0 and U–EFs of 9.1–18.8. The LFCs exhibit Mo–EFs of   4.5–20.5 and U–EFs of 4.5–5.4.

Silicon and oxygen isotope compositions (δ30Si and δ18O)     The silicon and oxygen isotope compositions for the Dawuba chert   are presented in Table 3. The δ30Si values of the Dawuba chert are be-  tween (cid:0) 0.3‰ and + 0.6‰. The δ30Si values of the MSCs range from   +0.1‰ to +0.3‰, that of the MFCs range from (cid:0) 0.3‰ to +0.6‰, that of   the GRCs range from +0.4‰ to +0.6‰, and that of the LFCs range from   (cid:0) 0.1‰ to +0.1‰. The δ18O values of the Dawuba chert are between   +21.9‰ and + 27.6‰. The δ18O values of the MSCs vary from +21.9‰   to +25.3‰, the δ18O values of the MFCs vary from +25.7‰ to +27.6‰,   the δ18O value of the GRCs is +26.9‰, and the δ18O values of the LFCs   vary from +24.4‰ to +25.1‰.   The formation temperatures of the Dawuba cherts calculated based   on the δ18O value range from 40 ◦C to 71.9 ◦C, that of the cherts in the   Manchang, Getuhe, and Luogang sections are 40–71.9 ◦C, 43.4 ◦C, and   52.8–56.7 ◦C, respectively (Table 3).   5. Discussion   5.1. Marine conditions   5.1.1. Redox conditions   If the influence of terrigenous input is extremely weak, Ce anomalies   can be used as an indicator of the redox condition of seawater (Zhang   et al., 2020). Al2O3 is primarily derived from terrigenous minerals and is   an excellent indicator of detrital input (Bostr¨om et al., 1973  Murray,   1994). There is a strong positive correlation between the ΣREE+Y and   Al2O3 concentration of the Dawuba cherts (R2 = 0.94) (Fig. 9A), indi-  cating that terrigenous input is the primary source of the REE + Y   (Zhang et al., 2020).   Moreover, Y/Ho ratio is another proxy to evaluate the detrital   contribution to ΣREE (Zhao et al., 2013  Chen et al., 2015). Ho is   scavenged by particulate matter from seawater two times faster than Y   (Nozaki et al., 1997). This process results in different Y/Ho ratios in   terrigenous sediments (~25–30) and seawater (~55–59) (Alibo and   Nozaki, 1999  McLennan, 2001  Zhao et al., 2013  Chen et al., 2015). We   investigated the detrital siliciclastic influence on the ΣREE of Dawuba     Fig. 10. Mo–EF vs. U–EF covariation pattern of the Dawuba cherts. The solid   diagonal line represents (Mo/U)auth of present-day seawater (SW), and the   dashed diagonal lines represent (Mo/U)auth ratios of 0.3 × SW and 3 × SW. The   gradational gray field exhibits an unrestricted marine trend from suboxic to   euxinic conditions. The light-purple field shows a particulate shuttle field   representing the depositional systems in which intense redox cycling of Mn–Fe-   oxyhydroxides occurs within the water (Algeo and Tribovillard, 2009  Tribo-  villard et al., 2012). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure   legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)     cherts show slightly left dipping (Fig. 8) (McLennan, 1989). The Lan/Ybn   values range from 0.31 to 0.73 (average: 0.56). All samples are char-  acterized by a depletion of LREE relative to HREE. The total REE con-  centrations (ΣREE) range from 18.83 to 107.73 μg/g (average: 42.85 μg/   g), which is lower than the PAAS compositions (184.8 μg/g) (McLennan,   1989). The Eu/Eu* values are between 0.71 and 1.25 (average: 1.07).   The Ce/Ce* values vary from 0.63 to 1.09 (average: 0.92). The Pr/Pr*   values range from 0.96 to 1.15 (average: 1.04). The Y/Ho values are   between 21.8 and 39.2 (average: 28.7).     Fig. 11. Formation temperature estimates of Dawuba cherts based on the δ18OH2O value of (cid:0) 1‰ (Taylor, 1974).

The Y/Ho ratios of Dawuba cherts are 21.8–39.2   (average: 28.7) (Table 2, Fig. 9B), indicating the strong influence of   terrigenous input on the REE compositions (Zhao et al., 2013  Chen   et al., 2015).   In addition, the Ce/Ce* value has a strong positive correlation with   the Al2O3 concentration (R2 = 0.44) (Fig. 9C), the terrigenous contam-  ination has a strong influence on the Ce/Ce* values. Therefore, the Ce/   Ce* values cannot be used to estimate the redox condition of the sedi-  mentary water column.   Redox-sensitive trace elements, such as uranium and molybdenum,   are soluble in an oxidizing water column but less soluble in a reducing   water column, leading to enriching in sediments  therefore, these ele-  ments can be used to evaluate the redox conditions of the paleo-ocean   (Tribovillard et al., 2006). Mo exists in the form of dissolved molyb-  date (MoO42(cid:0) ) in oxygenated water (Calvert and Pedersen, 1993  Algeo   and Maynard, 2004). In sulfidic settings with free HS(cid:0) , MoO42(cid:0)  is   reduced to thiomolybdate (MoOxS4(cid:0) x2(cid:0) , x = 0–3), which is subsequently   captured by sulfidized organic matters or Fe–S compounds and enriches   in the sediments (Helz et al., 1996  Tribovillard et al., 2004  Tribovillard   et al., 2012). U is present in the form of dissolved UO2(CO3)34(cid:0)  in   oxidizing seawater (Tribovillard et al., 2006). UO2(CO3)34(cid:0) diffuses   from the seawater into the sediments, and precipitates as less soluble   UO2, U3O7, or U3O8 under reducing conditions (Klinkhammer and   Palmer, 1991  Morford et al., 2001  Chaillou et al., 2002). The reduction   of U6+ begins at the Fe2+–Fe3+ redox boundary and does not require the   presence of free HS(cid:0) . Uauth enrichment commences under weaker   reducing conditions (i.e., suboxic conditions) than Moauth enrichment   (Algeo and Tribovillard, 2009  Tribovillard et al., 2012). In addition,   Mn–Fe-oxyhydroxides particles form at the chemocline can adsorb   MoO42(cid:0) during migration in the water and undergo reductive dissolu-  tion to release MoO42(cid:0) at the sediment-water interface  some MoO42(cid:0)  is   captured by sediments (Algeo and Tribovillard, 2009). The particulate   shuttle process can accelerate the accumulation of Moauth in the sedi-  ments, whereas Uauth is not affected by this process, resulting in the   elevated (Mo/U)auth ratios (Algeo and Tribovillard, 2009  Tribovillard   et al., 2012). Due to the differences in geochemical behavior between   Mo and U, authigenic Mo–U covariation pattern can be used to evaluate   the redox conditions (Algeo and Tribovillard, 2009  Tribovillard et al.,   2012).     The MSCs show Mo–EFs < 30 and U–EFs < 3, yielding (Mo/U)auth   ratios from 1 to 3 times the seawater (SW), showing a Mo–U covariation   pattern that rises toward the particulate shuttle field (Fig. 10), indicating   that a particulate shuttle might exist during deposition of MSCs. The   MFCs exhibit Mo–EFs > 30 and U–EFs < 10, yielding (Mo/U)auth ratios   of 1–10 × SW, plotting both within the particulate shuttle field and the   unrestricted marine trend (Fig. 10), indicating that a particulate shuttle   process existed during the MFCs deposition. The GRCs show Mo–EFs >  100 and U–EFs < 20, yielding (Mo/U)auth ratios of 3–10 × SW, plotting   both in the particulate shuttle field and the extension area of the field   with higher EFs (Fig. 10), indicating a strong particulate shuttle process   during the GRCs deposition. The particulate shuttle process is weakest   during MSCs deposition and strongest during GRCs deposition. The   particulate shuttle intensity is related to the redox conditions  thus,   MSCs, MFCs, and GRCs formed in suboxic, anoxic, and anoxic–euxinic   environments, respectively (Tribovillard et al., 2012). The LFCs show   Mo–EFs < 30 and U–EFs < 6, yielding (Mo/U)auth ratios of ~3–1 × SW,   plotting within the unrestricted marine trend (Fig. 10). This result in-  dicates their formation in a suboxic–anoxic environment.   5.1.2. Depositional environment   Sponge spicules in the MSCs are mainly monaxons and triaxon   hexactines (Fig. 4), which are siliceous skeletons of Demospongiae and   Hexactinellida, respectively. Both groups live in marine environments,   especially the Hexactinellida prefers deep and quiet water bodies, and   both contribute to the sediments in deep-water and basin environments   (Zhang, 1991  Flügel, 2010). The weakly oriented spicules in some   cherts (Fig. 4H) indicate bottom currents (Flügel, 2010). The well-   preserved spicules (Fig. 4C, E, H, I) indicate a very short transport dis-  tance from the spicule source area. The spicules without obvious   directionality (Fig. 4C) indicate in-situ or quasi-in-situ deposition under   weak hydrodynamic conditions (Huang et al., 1995). The MSCs depos-  ited in a suboxic environment (Fig. 10) and formed by an in-situ or   quasi-in-situ accumulation of sponge spicules which were released after   the decay of siliceous sponges, indicating that the formation environ-  ment of these cherts was a deep-water environment with slow sedi-  mentation (Flügel, 2010). Radiolarian-rich sediments mainly form in   deep-water upper slope or basin environments (Flügel, 2010). The   GRCs were deposited in an anoxic–euxinic environment (Fig. 10).

Radiolarians in the ocean were transported to the trough basin   and accumulated locally, forming the GRCs. The MFCs and LFCs formed   in anoxic and suboxic–anoxic environments, respectively (Fig. 10),   indicating that the cherts were deposited in a deep-water environment.   Early Carboniferous benthic foraminifera lived in shallow subtidal zones   of platform and ramp environments (Flügel, 2010). The foraminifera in   the MFCs and LFCs are mainly Endothyracea (Fig. 6). The endothyrid   group had a bloom in the Tournaisian and Vis´ean (Flügel, 2010). This   indicates that the protoliths of the foraminifera-bearing cherts were   calcareous allochthonous sediments which formed under platform and   slope settings that were then transported to the deep water area in the   trough basin (Flügel, 2010). In summary, the Dawuba cherts formed in a   deep-water environment with some contributions of intermittent   calcareous allochthonous sediments from the platform and slope.   Because the cherts in Manchang and Luogang sections formed in a   suboxic–anoxic environment, and the cherts in Getuhe section formed in   an anoxic–euxinic environment (Fig. 10). Therefore, the water depth in   the formation of the cherts in Getuhe section was deeper than the other   two.   5.1.3. Estimation of seawater paleo-temperature   The δ18O values of the cherts are influenced by the stratum tem-  perature and oxygen isotopic composition of interstitial waters (Kolodny   and Epstein, 1976). Knauth and Epstein (1976) proposed the following   chert-water oxygen isotope fractionation equation (Knauth and Epstein,   1976):   1000lnαchert(cid:0) H2O = 3.09 × 106 T (cid:0) 2 (cid:0) 3.29    (1)   (2)   (3)   The formation temperature of the cherts can be calculated based on   this fractionation equation (Knauth and Epstein, 1976). The δ18Ochert is   the δ18O value of the Dawuba cherts, and the δ18OH2O is the δ18O value   of the Early Carboniferous paleo-ocean water. Studies have shown that   the δ18O value of present-day ocean water is 0‰, which would change to   (cid:0) 1‰ if all the ice sheets of the earth melted (Taylor, 1974). In this study,   the δ18OH2O value of the Early Carboniferous paleo-ocean water is set as   (cid:0) 1‰ (in the absence of ice sheets), and the calculated formation tem-  peratures of the Dawuba cherts range from 40 ◦C to 71.9 ◦C (Table 3,   Fig. 11).   The chert formation underwent a diagenetic transformation of sili-  ceous ooze→porcelanite→chert (Kastner et al., 1977). As the tempera-  ture (buried depth) increased and diagenesis occurred, the 18O depleted   and δ18O values decreased gradually  thus, the formation temperature of   the most 18O-enriched chert was closest to the seabed temperature at the   time of deposition (Kolodny and Epstein, 1976). The lowest formation   temperatures of the cherts in the Manchang, Getuhe, and Luogang sec-  tions are 40 ◦C, 43.4 ◦C, and 52.8 ◦C, respectively (Table 3). Therefore,   the seabed temperatures during the deposition of cherts in the Man-  chang, Getuhe, and Luogang sections should be close to 40 ◦C, 43.4 ◦C,   and 52.8 ◦C, respectively. Previous studies have shown that the seawater   temperatures during the Early Carboniferous in central Hunan were   15–25 ◦C (δ18Oseawater = 0‰) (Shao, 1994), and the seawater tempera-  tures in the Visean on the Upper Yangtze Platform were approximately   25–27 ◦C (δ18Oseawater = (cid:0) 2‰) (Jiang, 1991) (Fig. 11). The seabed   temperatures during the deposition of the Dawuba cherts may have been   higher than the seawater temperatures, indicating that the cherts were   affected by hydrothermal activities during deposition.   Brock (1985) proposed 55–60 ◦C as the upper-temperature limit for   the survival of eukaryotic microorganisms (including protozoa and   algae) and 70–73 ◦C for prokaryotic microorganisms (including cyano-  bacteria and photosynthetic bacteria) (Brock, 1985). The seabed tem-  peratures during the deposition of cherts in the Manchang, Getuhe, and   Luogang sections were lower than the upper-temperature limit for the     Fig. 13.

Therefore, certain marine or-  ganisms were able to survive even in the presence of hydrothermal ac-  tivities, as evidenced by the observation of a large number of sponge   spicules, radiolarians, and foraminifera   in the Dawuba cherts   (Figs. 4–6).     Insights from petrology     5.2. Origin of chert   5.2.1.  Polarizing microscopy and SEM observations reveal that the Dawuba   cherts have abundant microfossils, such as sponge spicules, radiolarians,   and foraminifera (Figs. 4, 5, 6). The presence of abundant siliceous or-  ganisms in the cherts is evidence of biogenic origin (Gao et al., 2020a).   In addition, the siliceous organisms were the dominant silica source of   the Dawuba cherts. The silicified foraminifera still have a few residual   calcites in the wall (Fig. 6 B, C) and EDS analysis yields a minor amount   of Ca (Fig. 6R), indicating that the original mineral composition of the   wall was calcareous. The wall has been replaced by silica through   silicification, leaving a trace of calcareous residue. The cherts contain   foraminifera suggesting that they are replacement cherts. Spicule-   bearing and foraminifera-bearing cherts are found in the Manchang   section. There are many monaxons and polyaxons and few other mi-  crofossils in the MSCs (Fig. 4), indicating that the MSCs are biogenic   cherts. However, in addition to the silicified foraminifera, some sponge   spicules are visible in the MFCs (Fig. 6), indicating that the MFCs are   biogenic and replacement cherts. Radiolarian-bearing cherts are found   in the Getuhe section. There are abundant radiolarians and few other   microfossils in the GRCs (Fig. 5), indicating that the GRCs are biogenic     Insights from major element geochemistry     cherts. Foraminifera-bearing cherts are also found in the Luogang sec-  tion. In addition to the silicified foraminifera, some sponge spicules are   visible in the LFCs (Fig. 6), indicating that the LFCs are replacement and   biogenic cherts.   5.2.2.  The main sources of silica in cherts are terrigenous materials, sili-  ceous organisms, weathering products, volcanic activities, and hydro-  thermal fluids (Hesse, 1988). The Al and Ti in marine sediments are   mainly terrigenous (Bostr¨om et al., 1973), and the relative abundances   of Si, Al, and Ti remain constant during weathering and transportation   (Sugisaki et al., 1982). The Dawuba cherts contain signatures of detrital   inputs, which is confirmed by a strong positive correlation between the   TiO2 and Al2O3 concentrations (R2 = 0.92) (Fig. 9E) (Zhang et al., 2020).   Nevertheless, the SiO2 concentration is negatively correlated with the   Al2O3 concentration (R2 = 0.88) (Fig. 9F), indicating that terrigenous   inputs had a negligible effect on the silica in the Dawuba cherts.   Fe is mainly derived from hydrothermal activities and can be used as   an indicator of hydrothermal inputs (Yamamoto, 1987  Murray, 1994).   The Fe/Ti value is an effective criterion applicable to the origin of chert    the Fe/Ti values of the hydrothermal sediments exceed 20 (Bostr¨om,   1983). Most MSCs and MFCs have Fe/Ti values of less than 20, except for   samples ZMC-8, ZMC-18, and ZMC-24. The average Fe/Ti value of MSCs   and MFCs is ~17, which is close to 20, indicating that they are affected   by relatively weak hydrothermal activities (Table 1, Fig. 12). Further-  more, the Fe/Ti values of GRCs and LFCs are greater than 20, indicating   that they are strongly influenced by hydrothermal activities (Table 1,   Fig. 12).

The relative abundance of REE + Y in chert can be affected by   seawater and hydrothermal or terrigenous inputs (Gao et al., 2020b).   The western North Pacific seawater (49 to 800 m depth) displays REE +  Y patterns with pronounced negative Ce anomalies, distinct positive Y   anomalies, and LREE depletion (Fig. 13A) (Alibo and Nozaki, 1999).   High-temperature (>350 ◦C) black smoker fluids and low-temperature   (35–110 ◦C) hydrothermal fluids originating from the diffuse high-   temperature fluids display REE + Y patterns with significant positive   Eu anomalies and LREE enrichment (Fig. 13A) (Bau and Dulski, 1999).   River water certified as reference material SLRS-4 (National Research   Council of Canada) displays a REE + Y pattern with a slight negative Ce   anomaly, a slight negative Eu anomaly, and LREE enrichment (Fig. 13A)   (Soyol-Erdene and Huh, 2013). Due to high REE + Y concentrations and   a flat REE + Y pattern of clay minerals, the REE + Y patterns of cherts   can be affected by the terrigenous input (Tostevin et al., 2016  Gao et al.,   2020a). Although there is a strong positive correlation between the   ΣREE+Y and Al2O3 concentrations of the Dawuba cherts (R2 = 0.94)   (Fig. 9A), the Eu/Eu* values are not correlated with the Al2O3 concen-  trations (R2 = 0.08) (Fig. 9D), indicating that the Eu/Eu* values are not   affected by terrigenous contamination.   The PAAS-normalized REE + Y patterns of the Dawuba cherts are all   left-dipping (Fig. 8, Fig. 13B), and the Lan/Ybn values range from 0.31 to   0.73, indicating a depletion of LREE relative to HREE and similar fea-  tures as the western North Pacific seawater (Fig. 13A) (Alibo and   Nozaki, 1999). The MSCs show positive Eu anomalies (Fig. 13B), dis-  playing features similar to the hydrothermal fluids (Fig. 13A) (Bau and     Dulski, 1999) and hydrothermal jasper, iron formation, and Fe–Mn   deposits (Fig. 13C) (Slack et al., 2007  Bau et al., 2014). Meanwhile, the   MSCs also show negative Y anomalies (Fig. 13B), displaying similar   features as the marine hydrogenetic Fe–Mn crusts and nodules   (Fig. 13C) (Bau et al., 1996  Bau et al., 2014). The MFCs show negative   Eu anomalies (Fig. 13B), which are similar to the features of river water   (Fig. 13A) (Soyol-Erdene and Huh, 2013). In addition, the MFCs also   show positive Y anomalies (Fig. 13B), which are similar to the features of   seawater (Fig. 13A) (Alibo and Nozaki, 1999) and hydrothermal jasper,   iron formation, and Fe–Mn deposits (Fig. 13C) (Slack et al., 2007  Bau   et al., 2014). The GRCs show positive Eu and Y anomalies (Fig. 13B),   displaying features similar to the hydrothermal fluids (Fig. 13A) (Bau   and Dulski, 1999), seawater (Fig. 13A) (Alibo and Nozaki, 1999), and   hydrothermal jasper, iron formation, and Fe–Mn deposits (Fig. 13C)   (Slack et al., 2007  Bau et al., 2014). The LFCs show positive Eu   anomalies (Fig. 13B), displaying similar features as the hydrothermal   fluids (Fig. 13A) (Bau and Dulski, 1999) and hydrothermal jasper, iron   formation, and Fe–Mn deposits (Fig. 13C) (Slack et al., 2007  Bau et al.,   2014). The LFCs also show negative Y anomalies (Fig. 13B), displaying   features similar to the marine hydrogenetic Fe–Mn crusts and nodules   (Fig. 13C) (Bau et al., 1996  Bau et al., 2014). In summary, the silica of   Dawuba cherts was mainly sourced from seawater and hydrothermal   fluids, followed by river water, and the cherts show both hydrothermal   and hydrogenetic origins.   The Eu/Eu* and Y/Ho values of the hydrothermal jasper, iron for-  mation, and Fe–Mn deposits are 1.1–12.6 and 28.6–83.6, respectively   (Slack et al., 2007  Bau et al., 2014).

Insights from silicon and oxygen isotope geochemistry     values of marine hydrogenetic Fe–Mn crusts and nodules are 1.0–1.4   and 16.5–26.2, respectively (Bau et al., 1996  Bau et al., 2014). In the   Eu/Eu* versus Y/Ho cross plot, the Dawuba cherts fall in the area be-  tween the hydrothermal and hydrogenetic deposits and overlap with   both (Fig. 14), indicating that the cherts have both hydrothermal and   hydrogenetic origins.   5.2.4.  Silicon isotopes are typically used to determine the origin of cherts   (Ding, 1990  van den Boorn et al., 2007). We summarize the silicon   isotope compositions of some of the Earth’s main reservoirs, including   biogenic silica and chert, chemical chert, replacement chert, and dis-  solved silicon. The δ30Si values range from (cid:0) 3.68‰ (sponge spicules) to   +3.4‰ (Mesoproterozoic silicified spherical stromatolite and dissolved   silicon in river water) (Fig. 15) (Douthitt, 1982  Ding et al., 1988  Song   and Ding, 1989  Ding, 1990  Jiang et al., 1992  Ding et al., 1994  Wu,   1995  De La Rocha et al., 2000  Ding et al., 2004  van den Boorn et al.,   2010). The δ30Si values of the Dawuba cherts (i.e., MSCs, MFCs, GRCs,   LFCs) range from (cid:0) 0.3‰ to +0.6‰ (Table 3, Fig. 15), falling into the   range of biogenic chert ((cid:0) 1.68‰ – +1.42‰), chalcedonic sinter and   chalcedony ((cid:0) 0.58‰ – +0.62‰), and chemical chert precipitating from   mixtures of hydrothermal and seawater silica ((cid:0) 2.4‰ – +0.6‰)   (Fig. 15) (Douthitt, 1982  van den Boorn et al., 2010), indicating that the   Dawuba cherts have biogenic and chemical (hydrothermal and hydro-  genetic) origins. Moreover, the δ30Si values of the Dawuba cherts   partially overlap with those of East Pacific Rise hydrothermal fluids   ((cid:0) 0.4‰ – (cid:0) 0.2‰), dissolved silicon in seawater (+0.6‰ – +2.2‰), and   dissolved silicon in river water (+0.4‰ – +3.4‰) (Fig. 15) (De La Rocha     et al., 2000  Ding et al., 2004), suggesting that mixed hydrothermal   fluids, seawater, and river water were the silica source of the Dawuba   cherts. In addition, although the δ30Si values of the Dawuba cherts fall   with the range of silicified limestone ((cid:0) 0.5‰ – +1.1‰) (Fig. 15) (Ding   et al., 1994), we observe no calcareous organisms in the MSCs and GRCs   (Fig. 4, Fig. 5), whereas foraminifera are observed in the MFCs and LFCs   (Fig. 6), This result indicates that the former are not replacement cherts,   whereas the latter are.   Oxygen isotope composition is a sensitive indicator of the conditions   of quartz formation, so it can be used to determine the origin of cherts   (Clayton et al., 1972). The δ18O values of the biogenic silica and chert,   chemical chert, and replacement chert range from +12‰ for Archean   silicified volcaniclastic detritus to +38‰ for radiolarian skeleton   (Fig. 16) (Savin and Epstein, 1970  Mopper and Garlick, 1971  Clayton   and Steiner, 1975  Knauth and Epstein, 1975  Knauth and Epstein, 1976    Knauth and Lowe, 1978  Ding, 1980  Wu, 1995  Yanchilina et al., 2020).   The δ18O values of the Dawuba cherts range from +21.9‰ to +27.6‰   (Table 3, Fig. 16), falling into the range of the Neogene opal-CT in the   Sea of Japan (+19.6‰ – +27.74‰), marine silica (diatomite, opal,   chert) (+20‰ – +34‰), and opal from the hydrothermal chimney in   Mariana Trough (+14.6‰ – +37.3‰) (Fig. 16) (Ding, 1980  Wu, 1995    Yanchilina et al., 2020), indicating that the Dawuba cherts have   biogenic and chemical (hydrothermal) origins. Although the δ18O values   of the Dawuba cherts overlap with those of silicified brachiopods from   Devonian limestone (+19.1‰ – +27.1‰) (Savin and Epstein, 1970), we   observe no calcareous organisms in the MSCs and GRCs (Fig. 4, Fig. 5),   whereas foraminifera are observed in the MFCs and LFCs (Fig. 6).

Based on the analysis of silicon and oxygen isotopes, the Dawuba   cherts mainly have biogenic and chemical (hydrothermal and hydro-  genetic) origins. In addition, the MFCs and LFCs are also characterized   by replacement cherts. Moreover, hydrothermal fluids, seawater, and   river water were the mixed silica sources of Dawuba cherts.     5.3. Diagenetic model of cherts     The Dawuba cherts have complex origins, including biogenic,   replacement, hydrothermal, and hydrogenetic origins. The silica in   these cherts primarily originated from siliceous organisms, hydrother-  mal fluids, seawater, and river water. With an increase in burial depth   and temperature, the silica in sediments undergoes a diagenetic   sequence of opal-A → opal-CT → quartz (Kastner et al., 1977  Bohrmann   et al., 1994). Generally, the transition from opal-A to quartz proceeds   through a dissolution–precipitation mechanism (Riech and von Rad,   1979  Matheney and Knauth, 1993). The skeletons of siliceous organ-  isms are composed of amorphous opal-A, and most skeletons are dis-  solved during deposition and burial, and the dissolved SiO2 undergoes a     precipitation reaction to form opal-CT, which then undergoes a second   dissolution–precipitation reaction to form quartz (Riech and von Rad,   1979  Matheney and Knauth, 1993). Opal-CT, as an intermediate phase   in the conversion process from opal-A to quartz (Bohrmann et al., 1994),   is an authigenic mineral that directly precipitates from a silica-rich so-  lution, with the crystal morphology of blades, star-shaped clusters, and   lepispheres (Fl¨orke et al., 1976  Welton, 1984). The δ18O values of the   Dawuba cherts fall into the range of Neogene opal-CT in the Sea of Japan   (Fig. 16), indicating the presence of opal-CT in the cherts. Using SEM, we   observe opal-CT in the star-shaped clusters and lepispheres in the   Dawuba cherts (Fig. 17). EDS analysis of opal-CT shows the elements Si,   O, and Fe, with a minor amount of Al (Fig. 17 J, K, L). The silica-rich   solution may have dissolved Fe, which precipitated after combining   with the dissolved SiO2. Alternatively, the skeletal opal-A in siliceous   organisms may have been replaced in situ by opal-CT, which was then   replaced in situ by quartz without intermediary dissolution steps (von   Rad et al., 1978  Riech and von Rad, 1979). Sponge spicules composed of   cryptocrystalline quartz (Fig. 4 N, O, Q) and microcrystalline quartz   (Fig. 4M) in the MSCs and radiolarians composed of cryptocrystalline   quartz (Fig. 5O) in the GRCs indicate that they underwent a diagenetic     Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 590 (2022) 110863    17    \fY.

Conceptual model of sedimentation and diagenesis of the Dawuba chert, modified from Klein (1974), von Rad et al.

(2018).     transformation including in-situ replacement, and the mineral compo-  sition transformed in situ from amorphous biogenic opal-A to quartz.   The two kinds of diagenesis of the Dawuba chert are shown in Fig. 18.   During the Early Carboniferous, siliceous sponges and radiolarians   flourished in the Ziyun area. The Luogang and Manchang areas were   rich in siliceous sponges and the Getuhe area was rich in radiolarians   (Figs. 4, 5, 6). After the death of these siliceous organisms, most of them   dissolved and mixed with seawater, and some accumulated on the   seabed to form a siliceous ooze (Nelson et al., 1995), which formed   cherts after diagenesis (Kastner et al., 1977) (Fig. 18). Owing to the   difference in siliceous organisms, spicule-bearing cherts formed in the   Manchang and Luogang areas, and radiolarian-bearing cherts formed in   the Getuhe area. Each of these cherts has a biogenic origin. In addition,   fractures developed in the Shuicheng–Ziyun–Nandan rift trough basin   and deep hydrothermal fluids upwelled along these fractures to form   hydrothermal solution deposits, including barite (especially in the Leji   area), indicating that hydrothermal vents were present in the Leji area   (Gao et al., 2012  Tao et al., 2015). Hydrothermal fluids containing Fe2+  and H4SiO4 were ejected from hydrothermal vents and mixed with   seawater (Pufahl, 2010). Dissolved SiO2 from hydrothermal fluids, sili-  ceous organisms, and river water mixed with seawater to form silica-rich   solutions, and SiO2 directly precipitated to form cherts (van den Boorn   et al., 2010) (Fig. 18). The cherts in the Manchang, Getuhe, and Luogang   sections have hydrothermal and hydrogenetic origins. The silica-rich   solutions were supersaturated with respect to quartz and unsaturated   with respect to calcite (Knauth, 1979). Therefore, the silica-rich solu-  tions entered the calcareous allochthonous sediments, which were   silicified to form cherts (Knauth, 1979  Shen et al., 2018) (Fig. 18). The   foraminifera-bearing cherts in the Manchang and Luogang sections have   a replacement origin.   The Fe2+ in the hydrothermal fluids is oxidized to form Fe(OH)3   (Konhauser, 2007  Konhauser et al., 2017). The dissolved SiO2 adsorb to   the surface of Fe(OH)3 to generate SiO2-Fe(OH)3 particles, which settle   on the seabed and are preserved in sediments, and dissolved SiO2 and     Fe2+ regenerate after reductive dissolution (Fischer and Knoll, 2009).   Subsequently, dissolved SiO2 and Fe2+ combine to form an amorphous   Fe-Si-O-OH-gel (Klein, 1974  Klein, 2005) (Fig. 18). This explains why   the EDS analysis of opal-CT in the Dawuba cherts yields the element Fe   (Fig. 17J–L).   6. Conclusions     The cherts of the Lower Carboniferous Dawuba Formation in the   Ziyun area are rich in sponge spicules, radiolarians, and foraminifera.   Lithologically, the Dawuba cherts can be divided into the MSC, MFC,   GRC, and LFC. The analytical results of Mo–U covariation pattern and   microfossils types indicate that the Dawuba cherts formed in a sub-  oxic–euxinic deep-water environment with some contributions of   intermittent calcareous allochthonous sediments from the platform and   slope. According to microfossils, Fe/Ti values, PAAS-normalized REE +  Y pattern, Eu/Eu*–Y/Ho cross plot, δ30Si, and δ18O, the Dawuba cherts   have biogenic, hydrothermal, and hydrogenetic origins, and the MFCs   and LFCs are also characterized by replacement cherts. The siliceous   organisms, hydrothermal fluids, and seawater were the dominant silica   sources of Dawuba cherts, followed by river water. Siliceous ooze un-  derwent diagenesis to form biogenic cherts. Silica from hydrothermal   fluids, seawater, and river water chemically precipitated to form hy-  drothermal and hydrogenetic cherts. Silica-rich solutions silicified the   calcareous allochthonous sediments to form replacement cherts. Flour-  ishing of siliceous organisms, mixing of hydrothermal, seawater-   dissolved, and riverine-dissolved silica, and intermittent transport of   calcareous allochthonous sediments, played important roles in the   deposition and development of cherts in the rift trough basin during the   Early Carboniferous.

While the Bellman equation is uniquely solved by the true value function over all state-action pairs, we find that the Bellman error (the difference between both sides of the equation) is a poor proxy for the accuracy of the value function. In particular, we show that (1) due to cancellations from both sides of the Bellman equation, the magnitude of the Bellman error is only weakly related to the distance to the true value function, even when considering all stateaction pairs, and (2) in the finite data regime, the Bellman equation can be satisfied exactly by infinitely many suboptimal solutions. This means that the Bellman error can be minimized without improving the accuracy of the value function. We demonstrate these phenomena through a series of propositions, illustrative toy examples, and empirical analysis in standard benchmark domains.\"\n",
