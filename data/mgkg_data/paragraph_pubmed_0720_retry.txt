Randomization and blinding. Randomization was performed using a stratified block randomization method the stratification factor was site and the block size for each site was 2 with a statistical software package SAS v9.1.3. Independent biostatisticians generated randomization numbers and used them to assign patients randomly to each group in a 11 ratio.The treatment groups were recursive by order of randomization number and the predetermined values of parameters such as block size and seed number were recorded in blind codes. The study drug and the placebo which appeared identical except for the randomization number on the label were dispensed by order of randomization number. During blind coding both the blind codes for the first unblinding only either group A or group B were assigned to each patient and those for the second unblinding both group A and group B were indicated as either the study group or placebo group.Therapeutic Advances in Neurological Disorders 109318 journals.sagepub.com/home/tan. Statistical methods. To ensure 80% power to detect the superiority of tacrolimus assuming a two-sided type I error of 0.05 170 patients 85 patients per treatment group were required.

Myasthenia gravis MG is a T cell-dependent and antibodyand complement-mediated autoimmune disorder of theneuromuscular junction characterized by antibody-mediated skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability. It has a reported worldwide prevalence of 40180 per million people and an annual incidence of 412 per million people 13.Yang Shumei Li Yi Meng Huanyu Li Zhibin Jin Wanlin Xu Liqun and Yang Huan contributed equally to this work.Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article https//doi.org/10.1007/s00228-019-02642-z contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users.

Tacrolimus Tac is widely used in transcription and is also recommended for MG because of clinical practice and international consensus guidance for the management of MG 4.
Japanese researchers previously investigated the association between Tac concentration and its clinical efficacy in the treatment of MG 7. They verified that more patients receiving an adequate Tac concentration achieved Bminimal manifestation or better status compared with patients with a lower concentration. Given the limited research on the Tac pharmacodynamic pathways it is important to consider the association among the pharmacodynamics of Tac and drug response for individualized medicine.As a calcineurin inhibitor Tac suppresses the dephosphorylation of NFAT by binding to FKBP1A after entering T cells 8 leading to suppression of IL-2 transcription 9 and immunosuppression of the development of autoimmune diseases 10. The IL-2 gene polymorphisms were reported to be associated with the development of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis 11 psoriasis 12 and acquired aplastic anemia 13. However there are no studies examining the influence of IL-2 gene polymorphisms on Tac clinical outcomes in MG patients.Because of the roles of IL-2 in Tac pharmacodynamics we postulated that the polymorphisms of this gene influence Tac clinical efficacy in MG patients. Therefore we investigated the relationship between the polymorphisms of IL-2 and Tac response in MG patients.
In the present study we observed that the patients with the rs2069762 variant tended to be Tac ineffective. Those with the G/Tand G/G genotype in rs2069762 were also more likely to be Tac ineffective. One haplotype TAGG containing this mutation was identified among the Tac effective patients compared with the Tac ineffective patients indicating the association of rs2069762 with a Tac nonresponse. To our knowledge there is no validation for the direct association of the IL2 gene with the Tac response pathway. Previous researchers have revealed that the rs2069762 T>Gmutation located in the 5 flanking region of IL-2 could affect gene transcriptional regulation and further influence the function or expression of IL-2 in multiple sclerosis 11 and acquired aplastic anemia13. Therefore we infer that the rs2069762 mutation in a location where the IL-2 gene binds to transcription factors might offer a mechanism for Tac clinical efficacy. Thus it is necessary to validate the association of this mutation with the Tac response.
Myasthenia gravis is a rare disease and no standardized definition was recommended for Tac efficacy and therefore it was difficult to enroll a large number of patients in this study. Consequently the main limitations of our study were its small sample size and lack of further validation. Future studies with larger sample sizes and further validation will be required to confirm our findings.Acknowledgments The authors acknowledge the support by the nurses affiliated to the Outpatient Clinic of the Department of Neurology in Xiangya Hospital.Sources of funding This study was financially supported by grants from the National Nature Science Foundation of China grant numbers 8177051973 81571173 and 81501034.Compliance with ethical standardsThe study was approved by the Ethics Committ. ee of the Xiangya Hospital of Central South and all patients provided written informed consent.

Gender differences in prednisone adverse effects.
Details of the registry registry participants mode of data collection and collected participant-reported outcome measures were described in the previous study. We composed a Prednisone-Steroid use and MG Survey Prednisone Survey which included 11 questions asking the participants about the status of prednisone use current and highest doses and frequencies AEs experienced and willingness to increase steroid dose for better disease control. The 33 items included in the AEs list were derived from MGTX treatment-associated symptoms and treatment-associated complications. Participants were asked to select AEs they experienced from taking steroid prednisone and select them once more if any of them were difficult to tolerate appendix e-1 links.lww.com/NXI/A77. This survey was sent to the MG registry participants along with the semi-annual followup for those who enrolled before April 15 2017. Inclusion and exclusion criteria Patients age 18 years who answered Yes to Has your doctor diagnosed you with MG resided in the United States and completed the 9th semi-annual follow-up survey before November 29 2017 were included.
The efficacy of the corticosteroid medications such as prednisone rely on its pleiotropic effects on the glucocorticoid receptors through multiple signaling pathways which inevitably evoke physiologic signaling along with its anti-inflammatory effect. Women in this study not only reported AEs more commonly but also perceived them as more intolerable compared with men. Consistent with this result women more frequently reported that the dosage of prednisone had to be lowered because of AEs. Experiencing intolerable AEs was associated with a tendency to be resistant to a possible future dose increase if needed for an MG exacerbation and this was more common in women. A previous study that looked at symptom experience associated with chronic immunosuppressive treatment in heart transplant recipients and the result showed that clear gender difference exists. In the study women reported adverse symptomsmore frequently with a higher distress level and the pattern of symptoms was different from men. Women also experienced more AEs in the MG patient registry the MG population treated with long-term steroids. There are many potential factors that might explain this observation. Physiologically women have lower height and weight compared with men.
Eleven of the 12 enrolled patients had a thymectomy 7 to 42 months prior to the study.The results of this study revealed that 6 patients taking MMF had improved QMG and MMT scores while two patients taking MMF had signifi cant reductions in their required corticosteroid dose. Of the 12 patients one demonstrated a worsening of both QMG and MMT scores.After 6 months Wilcoxon signed-rank sum analysis demonstrated improvements in MMT QMG and activities of daily living compared with baseline p  0.023 0.001 0.004 with treatment effects seen as early as two weeks. Single fiber EMG was also performed in this study population but did not change with therapy. Some patients did experience side effects from MMF. Two patients developed a transient hand tremor and 2 patients were found to have a decreased hemoglobin level although one was iron defi cient. With the exception of these four patients MMF was found to be well tolerated and safe Ciafaloni et al 2001.In 2001 a retrospective analysis of the use of MMF 1 g twice a day for neuromuscular diseases was reported by Chaudhry et al 2001.

n prednisone. The demographic and clinical characteristics of these three groups were compared using the KruskalWallis test or Fisher exact test. For the analyses comparing the response to pyridostigmine with the response to prednisone participants who contributed an epoch of time on each treatment were included in both treatment groups. Although a matched analysis comparing each patients two treatment epochs would have been more ideal given the small number of patients n 6 for whom data on both epochs were available we opted for an unmatched analysis comparing treatment epochs rather than participants. The Wilcoxon rank sum test and Fisher exact test were used for the comparison of ocular-QMG scores and remission rates regression analyses were performed as needed to adjust for follow-up duration. We also examined time to remission by survival analysis. The level of statistical significance was set at 0.05 two-sided.RESULTS Study population. The cohort included 35 patients with MG 16 with OM and 19 with generalized disease. There were 19 men 54% and 16 women 46% the mean age at the time of diagnosis was 52  16.9 years. Acetylcholine receptor antibody titers were elevated in 20 patients 59% 40% of OM pa-tients and 74% of GMG patients.

Patients and methods. Nine MG patients treated with FK506 from September 2001 to September 2003 at Niigata University Hospital who were steroid-dependent or steroid-unresponsive or had worrisome complications with a high dose of steroids were enrolled in this study. Their dosage of PSL was not increased by more than 10mg/day within 4weeks before FK506 administration due to distinguish between the therapeutic effect of FK506 and that of PSL. Informed consent about using FK506 for MG treatment was obtained from all patients before starting FK506 treatment.
18 p 0.02 PBMC IL-2 production was decreased from the base to 4weeks in only one patient No. 6 end. No significant association was observed between PBMC IL-2 production and the improvement in the total Q-MG score.Although three adverse effects including an increase in hemoglobin A1C HbA1C level and a slight decrease in lymphocyte count were observed in three patients 33.3% Nos. 6 7 and 9 these adverse effects were not serious.At the dosage of 3mg/day or less the level of FK506 in the blood which is recommended to be from 10 to 20ng/ml 17 remained below 10ng/ml except for that 13.5ng/ml in one patient who was the oldest and had chronic renal dysfunction No. 6. end. 4 end. Discussion. Recently Konishi et al. Nagane et al. and Ponseti et al. have reported the efficacy of FK506 for the treatment of MG in non-blind prospective studies. However the long-term efficacy and safety of FK506 have not been well established. In this study we clearly demonstrated that seven patients 77.8% showed improvements in the total Q-MG score 1year after FK506 administration and the efficacy was maintained for a maximum observation period of 3years strongly suggesting the effectiveness of long-term treatment with FK506.
We report a 20-year-old female with generalized myasthenia gravis MG who developed atonic urinary bladder and accommodative insufficiency. Although her sera did not contain antibodies to either nicotinic acetylcholine receptor AChR or voltage-gated calcium channels a positive intravenous edrophonium test and a waning phenomenon on electromyographic studies indicated a diagnosis of seronegative MG. Myasthenic symptoms as well as urinary incontinence and impaired near vision disappeared with slight sequelae after corticosteroid therapy and total removal of the hyperplastic thymus. These symptoms recurred during a tapering course of corticosteroids and improved again with an increased dose. Therefore in this patient the neuromuscular transmission of muscarinic type of AChR in the smooth muscles was also affected. This patient provides insight into the mechanisms by which some smooth muscles are involved in MG.Keywords Myasthenia gravis Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody Urinary incontinence Accommodative insufficiency Muscarinic receptor1.

D  diopter.Repeated attempts to detect anti-nicotinic AChR antibodies failed when using a highly sensitive assay system cut-off value 0.07 nM Ohta et al. 1990. Sera obtained before corticosteroid therapy was begun did not contain antibodies to voltage-gated calcium channels VGCC Motomura et al. 1995 rheumatoid factors antinuclear antibodies or anti-DNA antibodies. Thyroid functions were normal throughout the clinical course.3. DiscussionFirst it would be pertinent to reassess the clinical diagnosis of this patient. Lack of gastrointestinal symptoms and pupillary constrictor muscle involvement on two separate episodes of recurrent generalized weakness is sufficient to rule out the possibility of botulism or diphtheria. Autoimmune neuropathy was unlikely because she showed brisk tendon reflexes and normal sensory systems. A combination of limb muscle weakness and cholinergic dysautonomia could occur in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome LEMS.
The data were gathered from two large and robust MG trials with designs that mirrored clinical practice and produced nearly identical results. How can these results be reconciled with the positive outcomes of previous studies and many clinicians experience with MMF in MGIn our opinion several factors could have limited the ability of these studies to demonstrate efficacy of MMF in MG. Study Duration. In the MSG study the predicted onset of benefit and hence the duration of the blinded-phase was based on the following reports and observations An open-label pilot study of MMF in 12 patients with refractory or steroid-dependent MG showed that 67% improved within 2 months after MMF was begun.3  A retrospective review reported clinical improvement in two-thirds of 85 MMF-treated patients with MG beginning at a mean of 10.8 weeks.5  In a review of 25 MG patients at two institutions who improved af. ter beginning MMF 22 showed improvement of at least 3 QMG points after 2 months.This experience suggested that MMF produces clinically significant improvement within 2 months in more than 90% of responders.
These patients were divided by current status into a group of MM or better complete stable remission pharmacological remissionMM n 226 and a group of improved or worsening status improvement unchanged worse or exacerbation n  246 Figure 1. There was no significant difference in baseline severity based on clinical classification ofMGFA between theMM or better group and the improved or worse group by Pearson 2 test. The treatment duration with PSL was also similar in the twogroups 6.5 6.4 vs. 7.1 7.0 years p 0.56. Patients taking<5 mg/day of oral PSL were more likely to be classified in the MM or better than in the improved or worse group 75.2 vs. 48.8% p < 0.0001. The daily dose of PSL was significantly lower in the MM or better group than in the improved or worse group 4.7  5.3 vs. 7.3  6.5mg p < 0.0001. The duration of taking PSL 10 mg/day was significantly shorter in the MM or better group than in the improved or worse group 1020 mg/day 1.9  4.0 vs. 2.1  3.9 years p  0.01 20 mg/day or more 0.6  1.2 vs. 1.4  3.5 years p  0.0002. In addition cumulative PSL doses received in the past year was smaller in the MM or better group than in the improved or worse group 1705.9 1791.2 vs. 2460.2  2009.8mg p < 0.0001.
These results suggest that early combination of low-dose PSL regimens with other therapies is useful for early achievement of treatment goals in patients withgeneralized MG. However only 64.1% of patients who received low-dose PSL therapy were able to achieve the treatment goal until 3 years Table 3. Approximately 35% of patients did not achieve satisfactory outcomes with the new treatment strategy. These results suggest the limitations of current oral corticosteroid therapy and the need to improve the safety and efficacy of corticosteroid therapy. FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS. Oral corticosteroids may be effective for good responders regardless of dosage. MG patients who respond well for various reasons may be able to reduce the dosage of steroids with less difficulty because dose reduction may follow the achievement of good outcome but not cause the outcome. Moreover itFrontiers in Neurology  www.frontiersin.org 5 August 2020  Volume 11  Article 868is not necessary to use high dosage of oral corticosteroids because a number of new treatment options are now available to achieve good outcome. It is time to reconsider high-dose steroid treatment for MG and seek a novel strategy based on patients QOL.

The estimatedmedian period to achieve MM or better was 5.0 95% CIs 2.87.2 months. KaplanMeier analysis showed no differences in cumulative probabilities between OMG and GMG P-value  0.764 Figure 3B. The estimated median periods were 5.1 95% CIs 3.96.2 and 3.0 95% CIs 1.05.1 months for OMG and GMG respectively.The treatment was discontinued in 1 patient on days 95 and 2 patients on days 182 to 190 because it was judged to be ineffective by the treating physician Figure 1. No patients experienced exacerbation or developed a crisis during the follow-up period. Differential Sensitivity of TAC Monotherapy for MG Symptoms. A total of 68.2% of patients 30/44 reported subjective improvement of ptosis within the first month. The median values of MG-ADL subscores during follow-up periods are shown in Table 3. The linear mixed model showed significant improvements inMG-ADL subcores for ptosis and chewing from the first month and for talking and swallowing from 3 months compared with baseline P-value < 0.05 Figure 4. For the symptoms of diplopia and limbs subscores of MG-ADL showed no significant improvement until 6 months and 12 months respectively. For breathing difficulty no significant improvement was observed during the follow-up periods Figure 4.
Six months later more than 65% of individuals achieved MM or better. Monotherapy with TAC in MG patients showed similar rapid onset of action clinical effectiveness and stable remission to those in whom TAC was coadministered with corticosteroids 1315. Our results suggested that TAC monotherapy is a reasonable option for patients who refuse or have contraindications for corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents.The sensitivity to TAC monotherapy for various symptoms was differential. Wakata reported that the symptoms of lower extremities grip strength ptosis and swallowing responded well to TAC in combination with corticosteroids 24. The percentage improvement in the non-facial composite arm and leg outstretch times grip forced vital capacity and head lift was less than that for vision and facial ptosis diplopia swallowing and chewing with CsA alone or CsA co-administered with corticosteroids 19 20. In our study a better response and a more rapid onset of action were observed for ptosis and bulbar symptoms talking chewing swallowing than for diplopia dyspnea and limb weakness. Therefore TAC monotherapy could be recommended as the initial treatment for GMG patients with bulbar symptoms and for OMG patients with ptosis who had an inadequate response to pyridostigmine.
Treatment improved ocular symptoms with the mean reduction in ocular-QMG score of 2.3  1.8 points. However 47 patients 38% failed to gain minimal manifestation or a better status. Patients with unfavorable outcomes also self-reported severe QOL impairment. Multivariate analyses showed that the pretreatment ocular-QMG score was associated with unfavorable outcomes but not associated with the patients QOL. Conclusion A treatment strategy designed in accord with a patients ocular presentation must be considered in order to improve ocular symptoms and the patients QOL. Background Since there has been no conclusive evidence regarding the treatment of ocular myasthenia treatment guidelines were recently issued by the European Federation of Neurological Societies/European Neurological Society EFNS/ENS. However the therapeutic outcomes concerning the quality-of-life QOL of patients with ocular myasthenia are not yet fully understood.Methods We investigated the therapeutic outcomes of patients with purely ocular myasthenia in a multicenter cross-sectional survey in Japan.

A girl born in May 1977 started to have ptosis of the right eye at the age of 15 years. Clinical examination and tests confirmed ocular myasthenia gravis without thymoma and she was treated with anticholinesterase compounds. At the age of 3-5 years ptosis and diplopia worsened and prednisolone 20 mg was given on alternate days along with pyridostigmine bromide 90 mg/day and distigmine bromide 5 mg/day. The ocular symptoms were inversely correlated with the doses of prednisolone and she alternated between transient relief and aggravation of her symptoms. Treatment with anticholinesterase compounds was unsatisfactory. At the age of 5 years ptosis and diplopia worsened during reduction of prednisolone dose figure A.
Metropolitan Neurological Hospital Tokyo Japan 5 Department of Neurology National Nagoya Hospital Nagoya Japan Accepted 3 July 2003 It is widely accepted that myasthenia gravis MG a T-celldependent chronic autoimmune disorder is induced by sustained production of an antibody to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors AChR at the neuromuscular junction.2 MG is characterized by weakness and fatigability of skeletal bulbar and extraocular muscles. During the past 30 years treatment of MG has advanced significantly and prognosis has greatly improved with dramatically decreased mortality. Experienced clinicians have recommended early9 thymectomy in nonthymomatous autoimmune MG although its indication remains controversial because of unsatisfactory controlled studies5. Although long-term corticosteroid treatment markedly improves the condition of some 80% of MG patients10 the problem of steroid resistance and side effects have still to be resolved.

The minimal detectable change MDC is the smallest change that is significantly beyond error of measurement.35 Therefore the MDC is useful to understand if a change in score is likely true changemore than error or not just errorbut does not provide the patients perspective. The minimal important difference MID is the smallest change that patients consider meaningful5 and it should be larger than the MDC to be interpretable. Different methods to estimate the MID have been proposed.
Demographic data were evaluated with means 6 SD or counts and proportions. There are no formal methods to calculate sample size for responsiveness studies but guidelines recommend a minimum of 50 patients.8 We aimed to enroll 50 patients per treatment group prednisone and IVIg/PLEX to ensure a broad range of treatment response. We used R statistical software v.3.1.2 and considered p values 0.05 as significant.Statistically significant change. Between-groups responsiveness. We compared the mean change inMGII scores between treated patients and controls expecting higher change in treated patients unpaired t test because of differences in baseline scores among treatment groups we used analysis of covariance ANCOVA to compare the 3 groups prednisone IVIg/PLEX and controls. We combined IVIg and PLEX in one group as they have similar efficacy.615 We also calculated between-groups ES816 for the total ocular and generalized scores.We studied the subgroup of patients with pure ocular disease comparing the mean change in scores in treated vs untreated patients unpaired t test. We expected significant change in the total and ocular scores but not in the generalized score.Within-group responsiveness.
MID individual Based on the receiver operator characteristic curves where responders were those a little better and higher n 5 58. a The receiver operator characteristic curve for ocular score had area under the curve 0.7 and thus was not reliable.6 Neurology 89 December 5 2017size estimations are feasible for future intervention studies. In addition the MGII subscores are responsive and the ocular component can be used for clinical trials in pure ocular disease. The ocular and generalized scores may have differential responsiveness according to the intervention and this should be studied with other treatments. The MDC and MID differ for groups and individuals and cutpoints for improvement should be chosen based on the clinical scenario. These findings support the use of the MGII to detect change in patients receiving interventions for MG. AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS.

Oral medications for myasthenia gravis treatment were given on the morning of surgery to all patients who were taking them. At the end of surgery the fourth TOF response T4 had already reappeared in all patients. The actual TOF ratio was 0.85 0.24 80.7 21.9% of the baseline value. In our hospital all patients receive sugammadex 200 mg >2.0 mg kg 1 for the reversal of moderate neuromuscular blockade. Therefore all patients in our study received this dose of sugammadex and tracheal extubation was attempted in the OR after reaching a TOF ratio more than 90% of the baseline value Table 4.In 12 of the 13 increased response patients the TOF ratio at the end of surgery was less than 90% of the baseline value. In 10 of these 12 patients the TOF ratio rapidly increased to more than 90% of the baseline value after sugammadex injection dose range 2.0 to 3.9 mg kg 1. One of the remaining two patients received an additional 200 mg dose of sugammadex total 6.5 mg kg 1 which resulted in her TOF ratio still only increasing to 69% of the baseline value.
Previous studies reported deficient vitD levels <20 ng mL 1 in 26.8% of adult women living in Buenos Aires 29 and 64% of elderly subjects from the mid-region 3334S 30. The incidence was even higher in institutionalized adults and subjects with the absence of sun exposure or physical activity.In this study to exclude the potential effect of some lifestyle changes in patients with a chronic disease that would expose them to a higher risk of vitD deficiency we evaluated patients and controls with questionnaires to determine vitD daily intake and sunlight exposure showing no differences between groups.In the Argentinian population included in this study we could d. emonstrate a weak association between vitD levels and the severity of the disease according to ADL score where we found an inverse correlation between both parameters. Namely patients with more severe disease higher ADL score had lower vitD25OHDHV MG<30 ng mL 1 17 59 >30 ng mL 1 8 7P < 0.05 considered statistically significant.levels. Consistently with other reports 1921 we also observed a higher proportion of MG patients having nonsufficient levels of vitD compared to the control group with a high likelihood for this association.
ational large randomized controlled trial of MMFor of any other immunosuppressive drughas been performed in MG.2021Here we report the results of a phase III trial designed to study the efficacy and safety of MMF as a steroid-sparing adjunct in patients with mild-to-moderate generalized AChR antibody-positive MG. We also discuss methodologic and practical issues arising from one of the largest ever therapeutic trials in MG and implications for future studies.METHODS This prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group international multicenter 36-week trial assessed the efficacy and safety of adjunct MMF CellCept Roche Pharma AG Grenzach-Wyhlen Germany in improving disease control while reducing corticosteroid dose in patients with MG. The study ran from August 2004 to October 2006. Initially patients were recruited at 25 neurology centers in the United States Canada United Kingdom Germany and The Netherlands. In 2005 a further 18 centers in Ukraine Israel Spain India Italy France Russia Serbia and Montenegro and Mexico were added because of difficulties in recruiting. All patients gave written informed consent to participate in the study which was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the principles of Good Clinical Practice.Patients.
In the follow-up phase therapy IA  HMP HMP alone oral PSL not exceeding a daily dose of 20 mg or pyridostigmine bromide 60 or 120 mg per day was administered as needed to maintain MM.The endpoint of the follow-up phase therapy was defi ned as 1 year after the beginning of treatment. Effi cacy of FK506 was evaluated by comparison of the number of treatments with IA  HMP or HMP alone during the follow-up phase and the dose of oral PSL per day required at the endpoint between the two groups of patients treated with or without FK506 see table 2 .The protocol for this study was approved by the ethics committee of our institute.Clinical Parameters Clinical classifi cation was performed according to MGFA 13  table 1 . Clinical severity was determined by patients and participating physicians Y.N. D.O. and R.K. not blinded to the treatment type according to MGFA quantitative MG score 13  table 13 . Each patient was assessed by the same physician throughout the course of the present study. The ratios posttreatment to pretreatment of clinical severity score were calculated.

Moreover CYP3A51/3 and CYP3A51/1 showed a greater effect on dosing interval adjustment than CYP3A53/3. 4 Discussion. To the best of our knowledge this is the first prospective PopPK study of tacrolimus in patients with MG to investigate the effect of demographics pharmacogenetics andconcomitant medications on tacrolimus PopPK parameters. The effects of the CYP3A53 genotype and Wuzhi capsule on tacrolimus clearance were confirmed in the MG population as previously reported 28 29.In our study the estimated typical CL/F value of the population was 17.1L/h which was lower than that reported in renal transplant patients 22.931.8L/h 30 31 and liver transplant patients 21.926.5L/h 27 32. It was comparable to lung transplant patients 17.536.5L/h 33 34 and was higher than that in patients with nephrotic syndrome 10.8 L/h 28 and in healthy populations 10.313.9L/h 3537. The only pharmacokinetic study in the MG population that was previously performed by Chen etal. 20 reported a mean CL/F value of 3.6L/h which isFig. 4 Boxplots of the distributions of simulated tacrolimus trough concentrations for CYP3A51/1 1/3 and 3/3 on 1.5 2 3 4 and 5mg q12h and 3 4 6 8 and 10mg q24h regimens for the non-combined Wuzhi capsule group in MG patients.

BMJ Open 20177e013278. doi10.1136/bmjopen-2016-013278 1Many patients with MG cannot fully participate in social activities due to the effects of the disease and its treatment.4 913 These patients therefore appear to suffer social disadvantages such as unemployment and a decrease in income which can lead to a lower HRQOL.911 13 However information regarding the prevalence of these disadvantages and their detailed associations with MG remains scarce. Therefore we conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire survey to obtain information on social disadvantages experienced by patients with MG. We also examined possible associations with detailed clinical parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients. This study was conducted at 13 neurological centres  Japan MG Registry Group see online supplementary table S1 in Japan. We evaluated patients with established MG between April and July 2015. To avoid potential bias we enrolled consecutive patients with various disease statuses over a short duration 4 months. During this period a total of 1088 patients with MG visited our hospitals. From this group we were able to collect full detailed clinical data from 923 patients and 165 were excluded from the study because of insufficient data collection.
Overall these multivariate regression models picked out similar items to those exhibited univariate correlations with social disadvantages the last paragraph and table 1.Clinical parameters and correlations with social disadvantages The backgrounds of the 917 patients and correlations of clinical parameters with the experience of social disadvantages in applicable patients are shown in table 2. In 680 patients who received income from employment the clinical parameters that exhibited significant positive correlations p<0.0001 r0.15 with experience of unemployment or unwilling job transfer and with experience of a decrease in income were identical these were thymectomy severity at worst condition MGFA classification bulbar symptoms QMG severity at current condition QMG MGC peak dose of PSL and duration of PSL 20 mg/day.

The rs9324921 A allele was more frequent in the GC insensitive group than in the GC sensitive group P  0.046 OR 1.94. Carriers of the rs17209237 G allele were less frequent in the GC insensitive group than in the GC sensitive group dominant model P  0.009. Carriers of the rs9324921 A allele were more frequent in the GC insensitive group than in the GC sensitive group dominant model P  0.037. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that the rs17209237 G allele carrier P  0.037 OR 0.12 and disease duration before GC treatment P  0.011 OR 3.45 were independent factors that contributed to GC efficacy. Conclusion rs17209237 in the GR gene was identified as an independent factor that contributes to GC efficacy in MG patients. The genetic variations of the GR gene may play a role in predicting response to GC treatment. Introduction.

Although SFEMG is widely accepted as a sensitive diagnostic tool in the evaluation of patients with neuromuscular junction disorders there is little data regarding the use of SFEMG as a measure of disease severity and response to treatment Howard and Sanders 1981 Konishi et al. 1981. As part of a therapeutic trial of mycophenolate mofetil MM in MG Meriggioli et al. in press we performed SFEMG studies before and after treatment with MM or placebo. METHODS end. We conducted a randomized double blind placebocontrolled therapeutic trial of MM in suboptimally controlled MG and the full results of that study are in press Meriggioli et al. in press. One of the secondary measures of efficacy was the magnitude of the change in mean jitter comparing baseline values to values obtained after 5 months on the study drug.

This does not appear to be the explanation for the findings in patient 13 because the percentage of fiber pairs with neuromuscular failure actually increased in this patient. Thus despite evidence of improved clinical function the physiologic abnormality in the tested muscle actually worsened.
disease end. And we are left to wonder whether this particular moment is a call to arms or a battle lost in the war for practicing medicine based on best available evidence in conjunction with clinical experience and acumen. Myasthenia gravis exacerbation after discontinuing mycophenolate. Objective To determine whether discontinuation or marked reduction of mycophenolate mofetil MMF in patients with myasthenia gravis MG causes MG exacerbations. Methods We identified 88 patients with MG who took MMF during the 5-year period 20072011 at our MG clinic. We then performed detailed chart reviews and recorded all MG exacerbations and their relationship to MMF and other treatment changes. We also recorded demographic data and disease characteristics including antibody status and Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America status. Results There were 14 patients who had an MG exacerbation during the study period. Of these 13 had discontinued MMF therapy with a median time until exacerbation of 16 weeks after discontinuation 9 patients or marked dose reduction 4 patients of MMF therapy exacerbation in the absence of change in any other component of the immunosuppressive regimen.
However supportive evidence from transplant patients hasbeen lacking as it is uncommon for individuals older than 80 years old to be candidates for transplantation.Given that MMF could trigger some viral infections particularly in elderly patients with MG we suggest taking precautions and monitor for these infections particularly in elderly MG patients and also weighing the risk of potentially life threatening infection versus the beneficial effect of MMF immunosuppression. It is not known also whether testing for CMV serology should be done on all MG patients prior to starting MMF. Since prophylactic regimen for CMV infection has been utilized in transplant patients it is not clear also whether the use of prophylactic antiviral agents in MG patients particularly the elderly ones or those with positive CMV serology treated with MMF is beneficial. Leflunomide treatment in corticosteroid-dependent myasthenia gravis an open-label pilot study. Leflunomide is an effective drug used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Here we report the findings of an open-label pilot study which found that leflunomide is also an effective treatment for myasthenia gravis MG. This study recruited 15 corticosteroid-dependent MG patients.
Additional two cases withdrew during the between the 24 and 36 month follow-up period after achieving complete stable remission. Metabolic-genetic analysis. A total of 39 patients were screened for the CYP3A53 genotype of which 1 2.56% was found to possess wildtype CYP3A51/1 18 46.1% had heterozygote CYP3A51/3 and 20 51.2% had mutant homozygote CYP3A53/3. Patients with wild-type and heterozygote and thus fast metabolism received tacrolimus doses of 2.60  0.99 2.36  1.17 1.91  1.45 and 3.00  1.00 mg respectively for the first year through fourth year. Patients with the mutant homozygote and thus slow metabolism received 2.44  0.89 1.90  1.29 1.33  1.14 and 2.50  0.71 mg respectively for the first year through fourth year. Since only 5 patients 3 with fast metabolism and 2 with slow metabolism who underwent metabolic analysis completed the full 4 year followup we compared the dose of tacrolimus of between the slow n  15 and fast metabolic groups n  14 using a 2 year follow-up period and no statistically significant difference was found Fig. 1. end. Follow-up.
It is clear that Th1 and Th17 cells are involved in promoting MG immunopathology and T cell targeted therapies such as tacrolimus may enhance treatment efficacy. Given tacrolimus mechanism of action against T cell responses we hypothesized that tacrolimus would suppress the Th1 and Th17 responses that are enhanced in MuSK-MG.Prior studies in AChR-MG patients suggest that trough concentrations of> 4.8 ng/mL or 7-8 ng/mL have been associated with favorable clinical outcomes Kanai et al. 2017 Ponseti et al. 2005. Our study supports that similar concentrations 10 ng/mL have profoundinhibitory effects on proinflammatory Th1 and Th17 responses while Th2 cells are not significantly affected. This suggests that future studies in MuSK-MG patients could use a similar drug concentration target to guide therapy.Th17 cells can be subdivided into pathogenic and non-pathogenic Th17 cells based on their cytokine profile Lee et al. 2012 Stockinger and Omenetti 2017. Pathogenic Th17 cells are implicated in experimental models of autoimmunity and more recently in human disease Hu et al. 2017. This cell subset is induced by IL-23 and simultaneously co-produces IL-17 and IFN- Gaublomme et al. 2015 Hirota et al. 2011.
Case Report This is a case report of a patient with severe and refractory myasthenia gravis MG who followed a high-dose vitamin D treatment a massive-dose treatment 80 000 to 120 000 IU/day promoted by a medical center in Brazil but still not proven and she had her first complete remission after this type of treatment with increased vitamin D serum levels 400 to 700 ng/mL. Conclusions This case report may reinforce the reported correlation between vitamin D level and disease severity and introduces a possible new use for vitamin D as a potential target for treating autoimmune diseases. We recommend large double-blind placebo-controlled randomized studies using high-dose vitamin D treatment for refractory autoimmune diseases to reliably assess this pharmacotherapy target for these diseases.
This treatment regimen also reduces the amount of PCT measured ocular deviation in primary and downward gaze. The immediate and long term benefit also occurred in patients who failed pyridostigmine alone. Prednisone decreased the frequency of ptosis in one or both upper lids from 56.4% to 16.3% at 1 month and to 15.8% atwww.bjophthalmol.com2 years. Our results contrast with those reported for childhood OMG where only 29% of 24 patients treated with unspecified doses of prednisone pyridostigmine or both for an unspecified time improved ocular motility.12 In the current study the frequency of maintaining improved ocular motor and lid function might have been higher if the prednisone dose was reduced more slowly as is recommended for controlling systemic muscle weakness.13 We reduced the prednisone dose quickly to avoid adverse effects. Some benefit was probably gained by the combination of pyridostigmine and prednisone. Our failure rate of 12.3% contrasts with Evolis study where 6/18 33% failed to improve ocular motor function with prednisone 2550 mg alternate day therapy.7 In fact of our eight failures only four 6.1% failed to improve with moderate doses.
Seronegative MG predominantly involves the ocular muscles and has a milder disease course than seropositive MG 1425.This appears to be especially true in male subjects which may be related to the immunomodulatory effects of testosterone 25.Myasthenia gravis may be congenital or drug-induced penicillamine can induce a myasthenic syndrome 4. Intracranial lesions can masquerade as MG or occur in conjunction with it 132128. Usually parasellar tumors or aneurysms these lesions may produce fluctuating ptosis and a positive response to Tensilon. Thus patients with signs and symptoms limited to the ocular muscles may need a neuroimaging study. Other conditions such as hyperthyroidism Graves disease multiple sclerosis Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome botulism Guillain-Barre syndrome amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and progressive external ophthalmoplegia are usually readily distinguished by the temporal course of the illness associated sensory or autonomic symptoms and/or by systemic symptoms not seen with isolated MG 417.To our knowledge there are no published reports on the participation of myasthenic male or female subjects in organi. zed athletics. In part this reflects the fact that MG was often disabling or fatal in the past even with the use of anticholinesterases.

mbenatarmed.miami.eduEfficacy of Prednisone in the Treatment of Ocular Myasthenia EPITOME is a multicenter randomized double blind placebo-controlled trial that is being conducted under the auspices of the Muscle Study Group. EPITOME is the first randomized control trial in patients with ocular myasthenia and aims to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of prednisone over a period of four months in patients with newly diagnosed ocular myasthenia whose symptoms have failed to remit in response to a trial of cholinesterase inhibitor therapy.Keywords ocular myasthenia steroids clinical trial evidence-based medicine. Introduction. Myasthenia gravis is a generalized disorder that often manifests initially as focal weakness. The most common focal presentation is ocular with weakness involving the extraocular muscles eyelid levators and orbicularis oculi. The two leading ocular symptoms are ptosis and diplopia.
Conclusions Our study showed that tacrolimus would be an effective immunosuppressant as an initial therapeutic agent in patients with MG in addition it showed tolerable safety profiles during the 12-month follow-up evaluation.

Patients with LRP4 antibody positivity tend to have a milder disease course compared with AChR or anti-MuSKpositive patients and can present with isolated ocular symptoms 3134. LRP4 should therefore be tested in patients who carry a suspicion of OMG if the AChR antibodies are negative.Muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibodiesMuSK-antibodies are present in 110% of all patients with myasthenia gravis 3536  and are more prevalent in women and patients of Mediterranean decent 2831. Among patients with generalized myasthenia gravis and negative serologies to AChR antibodies 2040% will be positive for antiMuSK antibodies 3237. MuSK antibodies bind to an extracellular domain and cause a reduction in the postsynaptic density of AChR 3 . Isolated ocular involvement is rare in patients with anti-MUSK antibodies which tend to have severe systemic weakness and be more symptomatic of bulbar and facial muscle weakness 38 . A retrospective review of 82 patients with positive anti-MuSK antibody showed that 3/82 patients presented with isolated ocular involvement. Anti-MuSK-positive patients with generalized myasthenia gravis had a similar incidence of ophthalmic findings compared with AChR-positive patients but involvement of the extraocular muscles seemed to be milder and less frequent 39.

every other day. However because her osteoporosis became more severe 6 months previously a switch had been made from PSL to tacrolimus 3 mg daily and her symptoms had continued to remain under control. Because her blood eosinophil count had recently risen in the absence of any precipitating cause the increase was suspected of being drug-induced and tacrolimus was stopped. However when she broke out in a rash 2 weeks later a drug eruption was suspected and she was referred to our department. Physical examination showed widespread purpura on her lower legs Fig. 1a end. Laboratory test revealed hypereosinophilia 7.82 9 10/l with elevated IgE 901 IU/ml normal up to 173 and high titers of rheumatoid factor 82 IU/ml normal 010. Myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody MPO-ANCA was negative and anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody showed an increased value of 48 nmol/l normal up to 0.2. Skin biopsy showed necrotizing vasculitis with a marked eosinophilic infiltration. CSS was diagnosed and when treatment with tacrolimus 3 mg daily was resumed the eruption almost completely resolved in 1 week Fig. 1b end. CSS is rare with prevalence of 10.713 per million inhabitants 1 whereas the prevalence of MG is 50 per million inhabitants 2.
When muscular symptoms due to PM are resistant to these drugs other immunomodulatory treatments such as high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin can also be considered as a therapeutic option 19 20. As this patient sometimes showed the reappearance of myasthenic symptoms tacrolimus was selected from among these candidate drugs because of its effectiveness also in MG 21 22 23 particularly in thymectomized patients following the guidelines approved by the Ministry of Public Health and Welfare of Japan. This drug is classified among immunosuppressive agents acting as calcineurin inhibitors and reversibly and strongly suppresses cytokine production mainly from helper T cells such as cyclosporin A 24. In this patient tacrolimus was used for the treatment of PM but also to prevent the recurrence of. MG. end. At present there is only one clinical report demonstrating the efficacy of tacrolimus in the treatment of refractory PM 25. According to this report all cases showed improvement of muscle weakness in parallel with normalization of CK in serum within 6 months of the initiation of tacrolimus. In this patient also the serum level of CK returned to a normal value 3 months after initiation of tacrolimus and muscle strength gradually recovered in 6 months.
Therefore TDM and CYP3A53 genetic polymorphism is warranted for tacrolimus dosing adjustment to optimize the treatment for patients with MG.References for online-only E-extra publication1 Cruz JL Wolff ML Vanderman AJ et al.The emerging role of tacrolimus in myasthenia gravis J.Ther Adv Neurol Disord. 20158292-103.2 Kanai T Uzawa A Kawaguchi N et al.

It appears advantageous to prevent GMG during the first year since the risk of developing GMG decreases when the duration of OMG exceeds 1 year and is even lower after 2 years. One of our patients who required 5 mg of prednisone every three days to prevent severe ophthalmoplegia stopped the medication after 3 years and developed GMG 4 years later. Prednisone treatment has a dual purpose restoring ocular function and reducing deterioration to GMG. We do not know whether low-dose prednisone would be effective once GMG has developed. Without a randomized trial which multiple authors 1316 and the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology have already asked for 12 this observational study appears to provide the only available data and suggests that early intervention with low doses of steroid therapy favorably alters the natural history of this disorder and both delays and reduces the frequency of GMG. However continued corticosteroid therapy appears to be needed in most cases.Acknowledgment This work was financially supported by Alice and Richard Netter the David B.

Six men and nine women with a mean of 45.6 years S.D. 14.6 range 2872 gave written consent to participate in a prospective open-label study. The study protocol was approved by the local institutional review board and authorised by the Spanish health authorities AEM protocol 02-0081 code MG/601200-T. All patients had undergone transsternal extended thymectomy at least in the previous 3 years and were under treatment with prednisone mean dose 33.1 mg/day range 1060 and cyclosporin 23 mg/kg per day plasma levels 80120 ng/mL.

The immune-regulatory effect of vitamin D is known to inhibit effector T cells directly and also induce Treg to decrease the production of inflammatory cytokines. Both vitamin D and Treg might be critical for T cell regulation 34. Previous studies have shown that vitamin D levels are low in patients with autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis 57. However there are few studies on vitamin D status in autoimmune neuromuscular diseases.The aims of this study were to evaluate serum levels of 125 OH2D and 25OHD in patients with MG and healthy controlsand the association of vitamin D levels with clinical severity and treatment status. 2 end. Methods end. end. 2.1 end. Subjects end. We reviewed data from the MG registry of Jeju National University Hospital and selected MG patients without taking vitamin D supplementation. We identified 34 patients and 9 patients refused to participate in the study. A total of 25 patients were ultimately enrolled. Diagnostic criteria of MG included clinical muscle fatigue and decremental response on repetitive nerve stimulation test in conjunction with the presence of AChR antibodies. We only enrolled MG patients with anti-AChR antibodies AChR-MG.
This corticosteroid dosage was comparable to that reported in other studies. The daily prednisolone dose at 12 months in our patients was 225 mg. This compares with a median dose of 17.522.5 mg at 12 months in patients at tertiary referral centres 4.On the basis of the guidelines all patients who received corticos-teroids for myasthenia gravis needed osteoporosis prophylaxis 12 because they received an average dose of 15 mg or more and 3 with a dose between 7.5 mg and 15 mg because of additional risk factors. Treatment was initiated in this cohort of patients prior to the publication of the guidelines. Despite this however 11 of 15 were given osteoporosis prophylaxis with biphophonate treatment.On the basis of this retrospective review all myasthenia gravis patients started on prednisolone fulfilled the current guidelines for osteoporosis prophylaxis indicating that most patients in this situation should be started on osteoporosis prophylaxis treatment at the onset.

Three patients 43% had previously failed other immunosuppressants. The initial MGFA classrecorded for the group was 2.71 6 1.1 whereas the worst MGFA class was 3.0 6 0.8.Patients had been taking MMF for a mean of 4.2 6 1.3 years range 26 years before initiating a taper. The mean daily maximum MMF dose in this group was 1642 mg 6 627 mg median 2000 mg range 50022000 mg. The observed taper occurred over a mean of 42.8 months range 25107 months. Mean follow-up at the lowest recorded dose was 22.8 months range 1254 months.When compared with those patients who were able to lower MMF doses but not completely discontinue medication a few differences were seen. There was a nearly significant trend toward shorter duration of MG before starting MMF 2.3 vs. 4.5 years P 5 0.06. These patients also had a lower maximum daily MMF dose 1642 vs. 2344 mg P 5 0.02 and a shorter duration of MMF treatment before starting the taper 4.2 vs. 5.9 years P 5 0.01. This subgroup was too small to draw conclusions but starting MMF earlier in their disease course may have resulted in a better outcome.Failed MMF Tapers. Thirty patients failed in their attempts to taper MMF 13 Mayo Clinic 1 University of Virginia and 16 Duke University. Of these 18 60% were men and 12 40% were women.

The mean dose at which MG relapse occurred was 888 6 755 mg/day median 1000 mg/day range 03000 mg/day. Mean time to relapse on that dose was 8.13 6 10.1 months median 4 months range 0.518 months.
1 end. Ten months after initiating the combined treatment the disseminated thymoma had almost disappeared Fig. 1 October 2005.Tacrolimus may be an effective agent for myasthenia gravis and disseminated thymoma. However it should be administered with caution due to its potential toxic effects such as cardiomyopathy nephrotoxicity and hematological disorders when given in high doses 6.In summary we presented a rare case with pleural dissemination of a thymoma that was reduced by treatments with corticosteroids and tacrolimus. Moderate doses of corticosteroids with tacrolimus may in some cases be an effective procedure for pleural dissemination of thymoma and such treatment should be undertaken on a trial basis for patients not indicated for surgery radiotherapy or chemotherapy. 4 end. Learning point. The administration of moderate or high dosages of corticosteroids with tacrolimus may in some cases be effective for treating pleural dissemination of thymoma.
