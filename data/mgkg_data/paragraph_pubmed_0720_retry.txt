The goal was to examine the short-term 12 week efficacy of mycophenolate plus prednisone compared to prednisone alone in patients receiving no other immunosuppressive therapy. A second article in this weeks issue of Neurology describes an international multicenter trial in which patients with MG on 20 mg/day prednisone were randomized to receive either mycophenolate or placebo.7 Once patients were asymptomatic or had only minimal symptoms the dose of prednisone was tapered. The goal was to evaluate the intermediateterm 9 month efficacy of mycophenolate as a steroid-sparing agent without compromising control of myasthenic symptoms in patients taking 20 mg/ day prednisone but no other immunosuppressive therapy. Neither study demonstrated any difference between mycophenolate and placebo. The authors do not suggest that mycophenolate therapy should be discontinued which raises the question of how the results of these studies should be interpreted. Does mycophenolate lack efficacy in myasthenia gravis The authors of these two studies discuss several possible explanations for the negative results other than lack of drug efficacy.
If prednisone accounted for all of the response than mycophenolate and placebo would have been equally ineffective. If prednisone accounted for only part of the response in each group then mycophenolate and placebo could have been equally effective. It may not have been lack of mycophenolate efficacy but success of placebo plus prednisone that led to the statistical dead heat between the treatment group and the controls.For the International study7 the authors considered other possibilities there could have been a lower than expected response to mycophenolate the primary outcome measure may have been too rigorous and possibly insensitive to clinically important differences the 9-month duration could have been too short and patients in the t. rial may not have been representative of the general population of patients with myasthenia.Indeed patients in the MSG trial8 were not selected for resistance to steroids as in prior studies. Even so mycophenolate plus prednisone yielded no better results than prednisone alone for the short-From the Department of Neurology M.B.

randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study oftacrolimus for MG treatment.16 It was designed to evaluate the ability of tacrolimus to reduce GC dose over a 28-week period while maintaining a stable minimal manifestation disease state no significant difference in the primary outcome measure was reported. Similarly no differences were observed in secondary efficacy measures including QMG score and MG-ADL however the study was not powered to detect these differences.16Here we report a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study conducted in China to investigate the efficacy of tacrolimus in the treatment of patients with MG who have inadequate response to GC therapy. Methods end. This was a randomized double-blind placebocontrolled multicentre phase III clinical trial conducted across 13 sites in China of tacrolimus capsules in patients with MG who had inadequate response to GC treatment. The study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines for Good Clinical Practice the current revision of the Declaration of Helsinki and the current regulatory rules of China. The study was approved by appropriate independent ethics committees and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Patients end.
Randomization and blinding. Randomization was performed using a stratified block randomization method the stratification factor was site and the block size for each site was 2 with a statistical software package SAS v9.1.3. Independent biostatisticians generated randomization numbers and used them to assign patients randomly to each group in a 11 ratio.The treatment groups were recursive by order of randomization number and the predetermined values of parameters such as block size and seed number were recorded in blind codes. The study drug and the placebo which appeared identical except for the randomization number on the label were dispensed by order of randomization number. During blind coding both the blind codes for the first unblinding only either group A or group B were assigned to each patient and those for the second unblinding both group A and group B were indicated as either the study group or placebo group.Therapeutic Advances in Neurological Disorders 109318 journals.sagepub.com/home/tan. Statistical methods. To ensure 80% power to detect the superiority of tacrolimus assuming a two-sided type I error of 0.05 170 patients 85 patients per treatment group were required.

Myasthenia gravis MG is a T cell-dependent and antibodyand complement-mediated autoimmune disorder of theneuromuscular junction characterized by antibody-mediated skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability. It has a reported worldwide prevalence of 40180 per million people and an annual incidence of 412 per million people 13.Yang Shumei Li Yi Meng Huanyu Li Zhibin Jin Wanlin Xu Liqun and Yang Huan contributed equally to this work.Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article https//doi.org/10.1007/s00228-019-02642-z contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users.

Tacrolimus Tac is widely used in transcription and is also recommended for MG because of clinical practice and international consensus guidance for the management of MG 4.
Japanese researchers previously investigated the association between Tac concentration and its clinical efficacy in the treatment of MG 7. They verified that more patients receiving an adequate Tac concentration achieved Bminimal manifestation or better status compared with patients with a lower concentration. Given the limited research on the Tac pharmacodynamic pathways it is important to consider the association among the pharmacodynamics of Tac and drug response for individualized medicine.As a calcineurin inhibitor Tac suppresses the dephosphorylation of NFAT by binding to FKBP1A after entering T cells 8 leading to suppression of IL-2 transcription 9 and immunosuppression of the development of autoimmune diseases 10. The IL-2 gene polymorphisms were reported to be associated with the development of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis 11 psoriasis 12 and acquired aplastic anemia 13. However there are no studies examining the influence of IL-2 gene polymorphisms on Tac clinical outcomes in MG patients.Because of the roles of IL-2 in Tac pharmacodynamics we postulated that the polymorphisms of this gene influence Tac clinical efficacy in MG patients. Therefore we investigated the relationship between the polymorphisms of IL-2 and Tac response in MG patients.
In the present study we observed that the patients with the rs2069762 variant tended to be Tac ineffective. Those with the G/Tand G/G genotype in rs2069762 were also more likely to be Tac ineffective. One haplotype TAGG containing this mutation was identified among the Tac effective patients compared with the Tac ineffective patients indicating the association of rs2069762 with a Tac nonresponse. To our knowledge there is no validation for the direct association of the IL2 gene with the Tac response pathway. Previous researchers have revealed that the rs2069762 T>Gmutation located in the 5 flanking region of IL-2 could affect gene transcriptional regulation and further influence the function or expression of IL-2 in multiple sclerosis 11 and acquired aplastic anemia13. Therefore we infer that the rs2069762 mutation in a location where the IL-2 gene binds to transcription factors might offer a mechanism for Tac clinical efficacy. Thus it is necessary to validate the association of this mutation with the Tac response.
Myasthenia gravis is a rare disease and no standardized definition was recommended for Tac efficacy and therefore it was difficult to enroll a large number of patients in this study. Consequently the main limitations of our study were its small sample size and lack of further validation. Future studies with larger sample sizes and further validation will be required to confirm our findings.Acknowledgments The authors acknowledge the support by the nurses affiliated to the Outpatient Clinic of the Department of Neurology in Xiangya Hospital.Sources of funding This study was financially supported by grants from the National Nature Science Foundation of China grant numbers 8177051973 81571173 and 81501034.Compliance with ethical standardsThe study was approved by the Ethics Committ. ee of the Xiangya Hospital of Central South and all patients provided written informed consent.

Gender differences in prednisone adverse effects.
Details of the registry registry participants mode of data collection and collected participant-reported outcome measures were described in the previous study. We composed a Prednisone-Steroid use and MG Survey Prednisone Survey which included 11 questions asking the participants about the status of prednisone use current and highest doses and frequencies AEs experienced and willingness to increase steroid dose for better disease control. The 33 items included in the AEs list were derived from MGTX treatment-associated symptoms and treatment-associated complications. Participants were asked to select AEs they experienced from taking steroid prednisone and select them once more if any of them were difficult to tolerate appendix e-1 links.lww.com/NXI/A77. This survey was sent to the MG registry participants along with the semi-annual followup for those who enrolled before April 15 2017. Inclusion and exclusion criteria Patients age 18 years who answered Yes to Has your doctor diagnosed you with MG resided in the United States and completed the 9th semi-annual follow-up survey before November 29 2017 were included.
The efficacy of the corticosteroid medications such as prednisone rely on its pleiotropic effects on the glucocorticoid receptors through multiple signaling pathways which inevitably evoke physiologic signaling along with its anti-inflammatory effect. Women in this study not only reported AEs more commonly but also perceived them as more intolerable compared with men. Consistent with this result women more frequently reported that the dosage of prednisone had to be lowered because of AEs. Experiencing intolerable AEs was associated with a tendency to be resistant to a possible future dose increase if needed for an MG exacerbation and this was more common in women. A previous study that looked at symptom experience associated with chronic immunosuppressive treatment in heart transplant recipients and the result showed that clear gender difference exists. In the study women reported adverse symptomsmore frequently with a higher distress level and the pattern of symptoms was different from men. Women also experienced more AEs in the MG patient registry the MG population treated with long-term steroids. There are many potential factors that might explain this observation. Physiologically women have lower height and weight compared with men.

While cyclosporine and azathioprine may cause nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity respectively these potentially severe side effects are rare to non-existent with MMF use Lim et al 2007. MMF is also thought to have a lower rate of induced late malignancies than azathioprine and cyclophosphamide. In addition compared with corticosteroids MMF has fewer adverse effects on bone health weight cataract formation and hypertension Chaudhry et al 2001 Meriggioli et al 2003 Allison 2005.The use of MMF does carry some risk. There is currently a FDA black box warning that indicates that the use of MMF may increase ones susceptibility to infection the development of lymphoma and may increase the risk of pregnancy loss and congenital malformation in childbearing woman. The most common side effect of MMF is gastrointestinal intolerance usually diarrhea however nausea vomiting headaches bone marrow suppression sepsis hypertension tremor neoplasia depression teratogenicity and an increased risk of infection may occur Chaudhry et al 2001 Amato and Griggs 2003 Draper 2008.
Eleven of the 12 enrolled patients had a thymectomy 7 to 42 months prior to the study.The results of this study revealed that 6 patients taking MMF had improved QMG and MMT scores while two patients taking MMF had signifi cant reductions in their required corticosteroid dose. Of the 12 patients one demonstrated a worsening of both QMG and MMT scores.After 6 months Wilcoxon signed-rank sum analysis demonstrated improvements in MMT QMG and activities of daily living compared with baseline p  0.023 0.001 0.004 with treatment effects seen as early as two weeks. Single fiber EMG was also performed in this study population but did not change with therapy. Some patients did experience side effects from MMF. Two patients developed a transient hand tremor and 2 patients were found to have a decreased hemoglobin level although one was iron defi cient. With the exception of these four patients MMF was found to be well tolerated and safe Ciafaloni et al 2001.In 2001 a retrospective analysis of the use of MMF 1 g twice a day for neuromuscular diseases was reported by Chaudhry et al 2001. Of the patients studied 32 had MG 15 of which had previously undergone a thymectomy.
Within 2 to 4 months of MMF initiation all patients demonstrated symptomatic improvement with maintained benefi ts ranging from 11 to 24 months. In addition all patients were able to reduce their corticosteroid dosage without any clinical relapse. With the exception of one patient who experienced initial nausea and diarrhea no patient had any signifi cant side effects from the MMF during this study Prakash et al 2007.MMF has been proposed as an alternative therapy for MG in patients who experience signifi cant side effects from other therapies. In a reported case series Lim et al 2007 demonstrated that MMF could be successfully substituted for cyclosporine in myasthenia patients with cyclosporineinduced nephrotoxicity. Two of 3 patients who switched to MMF experienced no neurological worsening of their MG with marked improvement of renal function once off cyclosporine. A third patient experienced improved renal function but had one signifi cant myasthenia exacerbation during MMF use Lim et al 2007.MM has also been studied in patients with purely ocular symptoms ocular MG Chan 2008. In a prospective observational study 31 patients with ocular MG and positive AChRNeuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment 200846 1207Ab were identifi ed and evaluated.
n prednisone. The demographic and clinical characteristics of these three groups were compared using the KruskalWallis test or Fisher exact test. For the analyses comparing the response to pyridostigmine with the response to prednisone participants who contributed an epoch of time on each treatment were included in both treatment groups. Although a matched analysis comparing each patients two treatment epochs would have been more ideal given the small number of patients n 6 for whom data on both epochs were available we opted for an unmatched analysis comparing treatment epochs rather than participants. The Wilcoxon rank sum test and Fisher exact test were used for the comparison of ocular-QMG scores and remission rates regression analyses were performed as needed to adjust for follow-up duration. We also examined time to remission by survival analysis. The level of statistical significance was set at 0.05 two-sided.RESULTS Study population. The cohort included 35 patients with MG 16 with OM and 19 with generalized disease. There were 19 men 54% and 16 women 46% the mean age at the time of diagnosis was 52  16.9 years. Acetylcholine receptor antibody titers were elevated in 20 patients 59% 40% of OM pa-tients and 74% of GMG patients.

Patients and methods. Nine MG patients treated with FK506 from September 2001 to September 2003 at Niigata University Hospital who were steroid-dependent or steroid-unresponsive or had worrisome complications with a high dose of steroids were enrolled in this study. Their dosage of PSL was not increased by more than 10mg/day within 4weeks before FK506 administration due to distinguish between the therapeutic effect of FK506 and that of PSL. Informed consent about using FK506 for MG treatment was obtained from all patients before starting FK506 treatment.
3 8 and 9 out of six patients Nos. 1 35 8 and 9 who received oral PSL at more than 10mg/ day at 4weeks before FK506 administration a reduction in PSL dosage of 50% without worsening of the symptoms was observed 1year after FK506 administration Table 1 and Fig. 1 end. The mean dosage of PSL was reduced by 3.3mg/day at 6months mean 14.6mg/day and by 7.5mg/ day at 1year mean 10.4mg/day compared with that at 4weeks before FK506 treatment mean 17.9mg/day.The total Q-MG scores at 6months and 1year after FK506 administration improved by 3 points or more in six 66.7% Nos. 37 and 9 at 6months and seven 77.8% Nos. 39 at 1year out of nine patients respectively Table 1. There were significant differences between the total Q-MG scores at the start of FK506 administration mean 11.9 and those at 3months mean 9.3 p 0.04 6months mean 8.9 p 0.01 and 1year mean 8.7 p 0.01 after FK506 administration Fig. 2 end. Eight patients Nos. 18 were observed for more than 2years and two Nos. 1 and 2 of them for more than 3years. The efficacy demonstrated for a 1-year period was maintained during the long-term more than 2years observation. FK506 monotherapy without a high dose of steroid was also effective in two out of three patients Nos.
18 p 0.02 PBMC IL-2 production was decreased from the base to 4weeks in only one patient No. 6 end. No significant association was observed between PBMC IL-2 production and the improvement in the total Q-MG score.Although three adverse effects including an increase in hemoglobin A1C HbA1C level and a slight decrease in lymphocyte count were observed in three patients 33.3% Nos. 6 7 and 9 these adverse effects were not serious.At the dosage of 3mg/day or less the level of FK506 in the blood which is recommended to be from 10 to 20ng/ml 17 remained below 10ng/ml except for that 13.5ng/ml in one patient who was the oldest and had chronic renal dysfunction No. 6. end. 4 end. Discussion. Recently Konishi et al. Nagane et al. and Ponseti et al. have reported the efficacy of FK506 for the treatment of MG in non-blind prospective studies. However the long-term efficacy and safety of FK506 have not been well established. In this study we clearly demonstrated that seven patients 77.8% showed improvements in the total Q-MG score 1year after FK506 administration and the efficacy was maintained for a maximum observation period of 3years strongly suggesting the effectiveness of long-term treatment with FK506.

We report a 20-year-old female with generalized myasthenia gravis MG who developed atonic urinary bladder and accommodative insufficiency. Although her sera did not contain antibodies to either nicotinic acetylcholine receptor AChR or voltage-gated calcium channels a positive intravenous edrophonium test and a waning phenomenon on electromyographic studies indicated a diagnosis of seronegative MG. Myasthenic symptoms as well as urinary incontinence and impaired near vision disappeared with slight sequelae after corticosteroid therapy and total removal of the hyperplastic thymus. These symptoms recurred during a tapering course of corticosteroids and improved again with an increased dose. Therefore in this patient the neuromuscular transmission of muscarinic type of AChR in the smooth muscles was also affected. This patient provides insight into the mechanisms by which some smooth muscles are involved in MG.Keywords Myasthenia gravis Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody Urinary incontinence Accommodative insufficiency Muscarinic receptor1.

Thyroid functions were normal throughout the clinical course.3. DiscussionFirst it would be pertinent to reassess the clinical diagnosis of this patient. Lack of gastrointestinal symptoms and pupillary constrictor muscle involvement on two separate episodes of recurrent generalized weakness is sufficient to rule out the possibility of botulism or diphtheria. Autoimmune neuropathy was unlikely because she showed brisk tendon reflexes and normal sensory systems. A combination of limb muscle weakness and cholinergic dysautonomia could occur in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome LEMS.
MMF 2.5 g/day in combination with prednisone 20 mg/day was found to be well tolerated and there were no group differences in the mean changes from baseline to week 12 in vital signs or any of the monitoring laboratory test results.A major finding of this study was the unexpectedly high frequency of responders in both treatment groups 85% of subjects in the MMF group and 77% in the placebo group were judged by the investigator to have had improvement 37% in the MMF group and 39% in the placebo gr. oup were considered to have shown marked improvement. These results can be interpreted as showing that MMF has no additional benefit over prednisone therapy alone in the treatment of MG. However the results could also reflect a better-than-expected response of MG to 20 mg/day prednisone or selection of subjects with relatively mild and immunoresponsive MG. Selection for such subjects may have occurred at the level of referral for entry into the study if the possibility of randomization to a lower dosage of prednisone constituted in the opinion of referring physicians an unacceptable risk for patients with newly diagnosed MG.
The data were gathered from two large and robust MG trials with designs that mirrored clinical practice and produced nearly identical results. How can these results be reconciled with the positive outcomes of previous studies and many clinicians experience with MMF in MGIn our opinion several factors could have limited the ability of these studies to demonstrate efficacy of MMF in MG. Study Duration. In the MSG study the predicted onset of benefit and hence the duration of the blinded-phase was based on the following reports and observations An open-label pilot study of MMF in 12 patients with refractory or steroid-dependent MG showed that 67% improved within 2 months after MMF was begun.3  A retrospective review reported clinical improvement in two-thirds of 85 MMF-treated patients with MG beginning at a mean of 10.8 weeks.5  In a review of 25 MG patients at two institutions who improved af. ter beginning MMF 22 showed improvement of at least 3 QMG points after 2 months.This experience suggested that MMF produces clinically significant improvement within 2 months in more than 90% of responders.
These patients were divided by current status into a group of MM or better complete stable remission pharmacological remissionMM n 226 and a group of improved or worsening status improvement unchanged worse or exacerbation n  246 Figure 1. There was no significant difference in baseline severity based on clinical classification ofMGFA between theMM or better group and the improved or worse group by Pearson 2 test. The treatment duration with PSL was also similar in the twogroups 6.5 6.4 vs. 7.1 7.0 years p 0.56. Patients taking<5 mg/day of oral PSL were more likely to be classified in the MM or better than in the improved or worse group 75.2 vs. 48.8% p < 0.0001. The daily dose of PSL was significantly lower in the MM or better group than in the improved or worse group 4.7  5.3 vs. 7.3  6.5mg p < 0.0001. The duration of taking PSL 10 mg/day was significantly shorter in the MM or better group than in the improved or worse group 1020 mg/day 1.9  4.0 vs. 2.1  3.9 years p  0.01 20 mg/day or more 0.6  1.2 vs. 1.4  3.5 years p  0.0002. In addition cumulative PSL doses received in the past year was smaller in the MM or better group than in the improved or worse group 1705.9 1791.2 vs. 2460.2  2009.8mg p < 0.0001.
These results suggest that early combination of low-dose PSL regimens with other therapies is useful for early achievement of treatment goals in patients withgeneralized MG. However only 64.1% of patients who received low-dose PSL therapy were able to achieve the treatment goal until 3 years Table 3. Approximately 35% of patients did not achieve satisfactory outcomes with the new treatment strategy. These results suggest the limitations of current oral corticosteroid therapy and the need to improve the safety and efficacy of corticosteroid therapy. FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS. Oral corticosteroids may be effective for good responders regardless of dosage. MG patients who respond well for various reasons may be able to reduce the dosage of steroids with less difficulty because dose reduction may follow the achievement of good outcome but not cause the outcome. Moreover itFrontiers in Neurology  www.frontiersin.org 5 August 2020  Volume 11  Article 868is not necessary to use high dosage of oral corticosteroids because a number of new treatment options are now available to achieve good outcome. It is time to reconsider high-dose steroid treatment for MG and seek a novel strategy based on patients QOL.

In the low-dose group PSL was maintained at a maximum dose of 20 mg/day usually 10 mg/day. When the symptoms did not improve sufficiently even when the dose was titrated up to 20 mg/day other treatment options such as CNIs and EFT PE/PP intravenous Ig or HMP were added to improve residual symptoms rapidly. The intermediate-dose group included patients who were treated with PSL 20 mg/day for longer than 3 months or who did not belong to either the high-dose or low-dose group. In all patients the PSL dosing regimen was decided at the time of treatment initiation and was not changed during the course of treatment.All clinical information and blood samples were collected after informed consent was obtained from each subject.statistical analysis The clinical immunological and therapeutic parameters were compared between three groups using one-way analysis of variance ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer test for continuous variables or Pearsons 2 test for categorical variables. Also multivariate logistic regression modelling was performed to determine independent predictive factors for MM-or-better-5mg at 1 2 and 3 years after treatment was started.
The low-dose group showed remarkably higher rates of combined uses of EFT and CNIs.Independent predictors for MM-or-better-5mg identified by multivariate logistic regression modelling Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified low-dose regimen as the sole independent positive predictor to achieve MM-or-better-5mg for 6 months after 1 year of treatment table 3.

Fracture rate in patients with myasthenia gravis the general practice research database. Summary The aim of this study was to evaluate fracture risk after onset of myasthenia gravis using the UK General Practice Research Database.
Introduction Myasthenia gravis MG is a neuromuscular disease which has been associated with an increased falls risk and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis recognized determinants of increased fracture risk. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of fracture after onset of MG. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the UK General Practice Research Database 19872009. Each MG patient was matched by age sex calendar time and practice to up to six patients without a history of MG and we identified all fractures and those associated with osteoporosis. Results Compared to the control cohort there was no statistically significant increased risk observed in patients with MG for any fracture adjusted hazard ratio AHR 1.11 95 % confidence interval CI 0.841.47 or osteoporotic fractures AHR 0.98 95 % CI 0.671.41. Further use of oral glucocorticoids up to a cumulative dose exceeding 5 g prednisolone equivalents did not increase risk of osteoporotic fracture AHR 0.99 95 % CI 0.313.14 compared with MG patients without glucocorticoid exposure. However fracture risk was higher in patients with MG prescribed antidepressants AHR 3.27 95 % CI 1.636.55 anxiolytics AHR 2.18 95 % CI 1.044.57 and anticonvulsants AHR 6.88 95 % CI 2.9116.27.

Favorable Effects of Tacrolimus Monotherapy on Myasthenia Gravis Patients. Background and Purpose Tacrolimus TAC has been proven to be a rapid-acting steroid-sparing agent for myasthenia gravis MG therapy. However evidence related to the effectiveness of TAC alone is rare. Therefore this study was performed to investigate the effect of TAC monotherapy in MG patients. Methods Forty-four MG patients who received TAC monotherapy were retrospectively analyzed. A mixed effect model was used to analyze improvements in MG-specific activities of daily living scale MG-ADL quantitative MG score QMG and MG-ADL subscores. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the cumulative probability of minimal manifestations MM or better. Adverse events AEs were recorded for safety analyses. Results Of the patients receiving TAC monotherapy MG-ADL scores were remarkably improved at 3 6 and 12 months compared with scores at baseline mean difference and 95% CIs 3.29 4.94 1.64 3.97 5.67 2.27 and 4.67 6.48 2.85 respectively. QMG scores significantly decreased at 6 and 12 months with mean differences and 95% CIs of 4.676.88 2.45 and 5.77 7.55 4.00 respectively.
It is usually necessary for patients to maintain immunosuppression agent for many years even for their whole life 1 2. Corticosteroids are the most common immunosuppressive agents for MG patients. However long-term therapy of corticosteroids is usually limited by severe adverse events AEs mood symptoms and cosmetic problems 35. In recent decades non-steroidalimmunosuppressive agents including azathioprine AZA methotrexate MTX mycophenolate mofetil MMF and cyclosporine A CsA have been successfully used in conjunction with corticosteroids to reduce the dose and side effects of corticosteroids 6. However the relatively slow onset of action of AZA MTX and MMF and the severe nephrotoxicity of CsA limits their use in the treatment of MG 710.Tacrolimus TAC acts in a manner similar to CsA and exhibits a similar effect to CsA at concentrations 100 times lower 11. Moreover it has a lower incidence of nephrotoxicity than CsA 12. Several studies have proven that TAC co-administered with corticosteroids can rapidly improve myasthenic symptoms subjectively within 1 month and objectively at 23 months 1315. TAC is recommended to treat MG in different countries and the international MG treatment guidelines 2 16 17.
The estimatedmedian period to achieve MM or better was 5.0 95% CIs 2.87.2 months. KaplanMeier analysis showed no differences in cumulative probabilities between OMG and GMG P-value  0.764 Figure 3B. The estimated median periods were 5.1 95% CIs 3.96.2 and 3.0 95% CIs 1.05.1 months for OMG and GMG respectively.The treatment was discontinued in 1 patient on days 95 and 2 patients on days 182 to 190 because it was judged to be ineffective by the treating physician Figure 1. No patients experienced exacerbation or developed a crisis during the follow-up period. Differential Sensitivity of TAC Monotherapy for MG Symptoms. A total of 68.2% of patients 30/44 reported subjective improvement of ptosis within the first month. The median values of MG-ADL subscores during follow-up periods are shown in Table 3. The linear mixed model showed significant improvements inMG-ADL subcores for ptosis and chewing from the first month and for talking and swallowing from 3 months compared with baseline P-value < 0.05 Figure 4. For the symptoms of diplopia and limbs subscores of MG-ADL showed no significant improvement until 6 months and 12 months respectively. For breathing difficulty no significant improvement was observed during the follow-up periods Figure 4.
Six months later more than 65% of individuals achieved MM or better. Monotherapy with TAC in MG patients showed similar rapid onset of action clinical effectiveness and stable remission to those in whom TAC was coadministered with corticosteroids 1315. Our results suggested that TAC monotherapy is a reasonable option for patients who refuse or have contraindications for corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents.The sensitivity to TAC monotherapy for various symptoms was differential. Wakata reported that the symptoms of lower extremities grip strength ptosis and swallowing responded well to TAC in combination with corticosteroids 24. The percentage improvement in the non-facial composite arm and leg outstretch times grip forced vital capacity and head lift was less than that for vision and facial ptosis diplopia swallowing and chewing with CsA alone or CsA co-administered with corticosteroids 19 20. In our study a better response and a more rapid onset of action were observed for ptosis and bulbar symptoms talking chewing swallowing than for diplopia dyspnea and limb weakness. Therefore TAC monotherapy could be recommended as the initial treatment for GMG patients with bulbar symptoms and for OMG patients with ptosis who had an inadequate response to pyridostigmine.
Infants born to seronegative and seropositive mothers with MG may have transient neonatal MG 21. Plasma exchange and immunosuppressive therapy such as the administration of prednisolone and azathioprine result in clinical improvement 242223. Mice injected with plasmaimmunoglobulin fractions from seronegative MG patients showed a defect in neuromuscular transmission characterized by increased sensitivity to d-tubocurarine 4. Moreover some seronegative patients have shown prejunctional changes suggesting that seronegative MG may be a heterogenous disorder 1. Mossman et al. 4 suggested that seronegative myasthenia was immunologically and physiologically distinct from the seropositive type. The target of antibodies relating to seronegative MG is thought to be a constituent of the neuromuscular junction other than the AChR. Despite reported immunologic and physiologic differences between seronegative and seropositive MG the pharmacodynamics of vecuronium were not clearly different between the two disease types in this study.Some investigators have reported differing severity of MG between seropositive and seronegative patients 13. Oh 3 showed a tendency toward more marked impairment in seropositive patients than in seronegative patients but this difference was notTable 2.
Treatment improved ocular symptoms with the mean reduction in ocular-QMG score of 2.3  1.8 points. However 47 patients 38% failed to gain minimal manifestation or a better status. Patients with unfavorable outcomes also self-reported severe QOL impairment. Multivariate analyses showed that the pretreatment ocular-QMG score was associated with unfavorable outcomes but not associated with the patients QOL. Conclusion A treatment strategy designed in accord with a patients ocular presentation must be considered in order to improve ocular symptoms and the patients QOL. Background Since there has been no conclusive evidence regarding the treatment of ocular myasthenia treatment guidelines were recently issued by the European Federation of Neurological Societies/European Neurological Society EFNS/ENS. However the therapeutic outcomes concerning the quality-of-life QOL of patients with ocular myasthenia are not yet fully understood.Methods We investigated the therapeutic outcomes of patients with purely ocular myasthenia in a multicenter cross-sectional survey in Japan. To evaluate the severity of ocular symptoms we used the ocular-quantitative MG QMG score advocated by Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America.
During the entire clinical course 81 patients experienced both ptosis and diplopia 36 had ptosis alone and six had diplopia alone. Acetyl-cholinesterase inhibitors and prednisolone were used in 98 and 52 patients respectively. Treatment improved ocular symptoms with the mean reduction in ocular-QMG score of 2.3  1.8 points. However 47 patients 38% failed to gain minimal manifestation or a better status. Patients with unfavorable outcomes also self-reported severe QOL impairment. Multivariate analyses showed that the pretreatment ocular-QMG score was associated with unfavorable outcomes but not associated with the patients QOL.Conclusion A treatment strategy designed in accord with a patients ocular presentation must be considered in order to improve ocular symptoms and the patients QOL.Keywords Ocular myasthenia Ocular-quantitative myasthenia gravis score Quality-of-life Therapeutic outcome. Background. Ocular myasthenia is a form of myasthenia gravis MG that is clinically restricted to extrinsic ocular muscles 12. Clinical signs of ocular myasthenia can be highly variable ranging from mild unilateral ptosis to complete opthalmoplegia. Ptosis and diplopia may be present involving various combinations of the levator palpebrae the two obliques and the four recti muscles.

This is the first report of an association between MG and camptocormia. Clinicians should be aware that camptocormia is a potentially treatable condition in patients with MG. In patients presenting with camptocormia it is important to look for clinical and laboratory evidence of muscle involvement other than that in the spine as such findings may facilitate a correct diagnosis.

Sugammadex in patients with myasthenia gravis.
The authors suggest that more evidence is required to examine the use of sugammadex in patients with myasthenia gravis.We would like to report our experience with two patients with mild generalised muscle weakness class IIa in myasthenia gravis severity classification system by Osserman and Jenkins 2 and on chronic cholinesterase inhibitor medication in which we reversed an intense rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block with sugammadex. Both patients were scheduled for short procedures and subsequently gave consent for publication.After inducing neuromuscular block with rocuronium 0.15 mg.kg1 which is 25% of the standard dose required for tracheal intubation in normal patients both patients developed an intense neuromuscular block 3. At the end of the surgical procedure monitoring of the neuromuscular function TOF-Watch SX MSD  Shering-Plough Ireland Ltd Dublin Ireland showed no response of the train-of-four and a post-tetanic count was 0. We then reversed the block with 4.0 mg.kg1 sugammadex. The time from the administration of sugammadex to 90% recovery of the train-of-four ratio was 162 s for the first patient and 135 s for the second. No adverse changes were observed in arterial blood pressure heart rate or ECG after the administration of sugammadex.
Based on data from organ-transplantation studies the MMF dose was 1 g twice a day in most studies in MG. Benefits included improvement in muscle strength with reduction in AChR antibody titers 17 and reduction or discontinuation of concomitant therapy 16-19 . Importantly some authors recorded clinical improvement as early as 3 weeks after MMF was begun 17 . Apart from dose-dependent hemolytic anemia in one patient 17  no serious side effects were reported in these studies.In an open-label pilot study of patients with refractory or steroid-dependent MG 8 of 12 patients 67% treated with MMF for 6 months showed improvement within the first 2 months of treatment 20 .In a retrospective review of 32 patients with MG MMF 1 g was given twice daily for 3  36 months mean 11 months as an adjunct or steroid sparing agent 29 patients or as sole therapy 3 patien. ts 21  end. Overall 69% showed either improvement in functional status 59% reduction in steroid dose 50% or both. The earliest clinical response was recorded at 2 months but the mean time to improvement was 4.8 months with some patients not showing any benefit until 12 months into the treatment. Interestingly patients with shorter disease duration mean 7.5 years versus 14 years showed a more favorable response to MMF.

A girl born in May 1977 started to have ptosis of the right eye at the age of 15 years. Clinical examination and tests confirmed ocular myasthenia gravis without thymoma and she was treated with anticholinesterase compounds. At the age of 3-5 years ptosis and diplopia worsened and prednisolone 20 mg was given on alternate days along with pyridostigmine bromide 90 mg/day and distigmine bromide 5 mg/day. The ocular symptoms were inversely correlated with the doses of prednisolone and she alternated between transient relief and aggravation of her symptoms. Treatment with anticholinesterase compounds was unsatisfactory. At the age of 5 years ptosis and diplopia worsened during reduction of prednisolone dose figure A.
Metropolitan Neurological Hospital Tokyo Japan 5 Department of Neurology National Nagoya Hospital Nagoya Japan Accepted 3 July 2003 It is widely accepted that myasthenia gravis MG a T-celldependent chronic autoimmune disorder is induced by sustained production of an antibody to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors AChR at the neuromuscular junction.2 MG is characterized by weakness and fatigability of skeletal bulbar and extraocular muscles. During the past 30 years treatment of MG has advanced significantly and prognosis has greatly improved with dramatically decreased mortality. Experienced clinicians have recommended early9 thymectomy in nonthymomatous autoimmune MG although its indication remains controversial because of unsatisfactory controlled studies5. Although long-term corticosteroid treatment markedly improves the condition of some 80% of MG patients10 the problem of steroid resistance and side effects have still to be resolved.

The minimal detectable change MDC is the smallest change that is significantly beyond error of measurement.35 Therefore the MDC is useful to understand if a change in score is likely true changemore than error or not just errorbut does not provide the patients perspective. The minimal important difference MID is the smallest change that patients consider meaningful5 and it should be larger than the MDC to be interpretable. Different methods to estimate the MID have been proposed.
Demographic data were evaluated with means 6 SD or counts and proportions. There are no formal methods to calculate sample size for responsiveness studies but guidelines recommend a minimum of 50 patients.8 We aimed to enroll 50 patients per treatment group prednisone and IVIg/PLEX to ensure a broad range of treatment response. We used R statistical software v.3.1.2 and considered p values 0.05 as significant.Statistically significant change. Between-groups responsiveness. We compared the mean change inMGII scores between treated patients and controls expecting higher change in treated patients unpaired t test because of differences in baseline scores among treatment groups we used analysis of covariance ANCOVA to compare the 3 groups prednisone IVIg/PLEX and controls. We combined IVIg and PLEX in one group as they have similar efficacy.615 We also calculated between-groups ES816 for the total ocular and generalized scores.We studied the subgroup of patients with pure ocular disease comparing the mean change in scores in treated vs untreated patients unpaired t test. We expected significant change in the total and ocular scores but not in the generalized score.Within-group responsiveness.
MID individual Based on the receiver operator characteristic curves where responders were those a little better and higher n 5 58. a The receiver operator characteristic curve for ocular score had area under the curve 0.7 and thus was not reliable.6 Neurology 89 December 5 2017size estimations are feasible for future intervention studies. In addition the MGII subscores are responsive and the ocular component can be used for clinical trials in pure ocular disease. The ocular and generalized scores may have differential responsiveness according to the intervention and this should be studied with other treatments. The MDC and MID differ for groups and individuals and cutpoints for improvement should be chosen based on the clinical scenario. These findings support the use of the MGII to detect change in patients receiving interventions for MG. AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS.

Oral medications for myasthenia gravis treatment were given on the morning of surgery to all patients who were taking them. At the end of surgery the fourth TOF response T4 had already reappeared in all patients. The actual TOF ratio was 0.85 0.24 80.7 21.9% of the baseline value. In our hospital all patients receive sugammadex 200 mg >2.0 mg kg 1 for the reversal of moderate neuromuscular blockade. Therefore all patients in our study received this dose of sugammadex and tracheal extubation was attempted in the OR after reaching a TOF ratio more than 90% of the baseline value Table 4.In 12 of the 13 increased response patients the TOF ratio at the end of surgery was less than 90% of the baseline value. In 10 of these 12 patients the TOF ratio rapidly increased to more than 90% of the baseline value after sugammadex injection dose range 2.0 to 3.9 mg kg 1. One of the remaining two patients received an additional 200 mg dose of sugammadex total 6.5 mg kg 1 which resulted in her TOF ratio still only increasing to 69% of the baseline value.

The incidence was even higher in institutionalized adults and subjects with the absence of sun exposure or physical activity.In this study to exclude the potential effect of some lifestyle changes in patients with a chronic disease that would expose them to a higher risk of vitD deficiency we evaluated patients and controls with questionnaires to determine vitD daily intake and sunlight exposure showing no differences between groups.In the Argentinian population included in this study we could d. emonstrate a weak association between vitD levels and the severity of the disease according to ADL score where we found an inverse correlation between both parameters. Namely patients with more severe disease higher ADL score had lower vitD25OHDHV MG<30 ng mL 1 17 59 >30 ng mL 1 8 7P < 0.05 considered statistically significant.levels. Consistently with other reports 1921 we also observed a higher proportion of MG patients having nonsufficient levels of vitD compared to the control group with a high likelihood for this association.
OUTCOME MEASURES. Efficacy was measured in terms of clinical state muscle strength and serum anti-AChR antibody levels. Other outcomes included duration of successful treatment with tacrolimus and degree of prednisone dose reduction. Adverse events were monitored. RESULTS end. Of the 79 patients who completed the study 96% were treated successfully with tacrolimus for more than 1 year n  76 this figure decreased to 95% n  75 at 2 years and 92% n  73 after 3 years. A significant increase in muscle strength was observed P <0.0001 and a mean increase of 39% was recorded at the close of the study. At the final followup visit there was a significant decrease in the mean concentration of serum anti-AChR antibodies P <0.0001. In addition 88.6% of patients demonstrated pharmacological remission 6.4% had minimal symptoms and 5.1% were in complete stable remission. Prednisone doses were reduced and ultimately withdrawn in 98% of patients and the proportion of patients with adverse effects related to ciclosporin and prednisone decreased from a baseline value of 96.2% to 35.4% at the final follow-up visit P <0.001. CONCLUSION. Tacrolimus is an effective long-term immunosuppressive medication for myasthenia gravis. It is well tolerated and produces no adverse effects. GLOSSARY end. end.
The mean anti-AChR Ab ratio was significantly lower in the IA  HMP than IA alone groups at 1 month p  0.01 after each treatment table 2. Both the severity and antiAChR Ab ratios increased within 1 month after IA alone which was consistent with a previous report 4. These findings suggest that IA  HMP produce more immediate effects on MG for up to 1 month compared with IA alone. The mean PSL dose ratio did not differ between the IA  HMP and IA alone groups at least within 1 month table 2.After the total observation period both the severity and antiAChR Ab ratios were significantly lower in patients receiving IA  HMP than in patients receiving IA alone 0.29 B 0.31 vs. 0.72 B 0.32 and 0.38 B 0.27 vs. 0.70 B 0.23 respectively p  0.01 table 2. Although the total observation period was longer for the patients receiving IA  HMP than IA alone table 2 no significant correlation was observed with severity r  0.20 p  0.48 anti-AChR Ab r  0.22 p  0.42 and PSL dose ratios r  0.09 p  0.77. These results indicate that IA  HMP for a longer interval mean 151 days is more effective than IA alone for a shorter interval mean 29 days.
In contrast 4 of the present patients receiving IA  HMP demonstrated remission no symptom with no medication for more than 1 year. Therefore combined therapy with IA  HMP appears more effective than IA alone or in all likelihood HMP alone. Furthermore the PSL dose ratio was significantly lower in patients receiving IA  HMP than in patients receiving IA alone 0.58 B 0.29 vs. 1.03 B 0.61 p  0.01 after the total observation period table 2 suggesting that IA  HMP treatment may allow for a reduced dose of oral PSL per day for normal life in MG patients. As the combined therapy with IA  HMP exhibits no serious complications it can be used not only to overcome acute deterioration as plasma exchange but also to reduce the dose of oral PSL and aim at remission. The anti-AChR Ab ratio together with clinical severity can be an indicator for the therapeutic response to IA or IA  HMP for individual patients.In conclusion the combined therapy with IA and HMP appears to be more effective for the treatment of MG compared with IA alone although further studies are needed to compare the effect of IA  HMP and HMP alone.

ational large randomized controlled trial of MMFor of any other immunosuppressive drughas been performed in MG.2021Here we report the results of a phase III trial designed to study the efficacy and safety of MMF as a steroid-sparing adjunct in patients with mild-to-moderate generalized AChR antibody-positive MG. We also discuss methodologic and practical issues arising from one of the largest ever therapeutic trials in MG and implications for future studies.METHODS This prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group international multicenter 36-week trial assessed the efficacy and safety of adjunct MMF CellCept Roche Pharma AG Grenzach-Wyhlen Germany in improving disease control while reducing corticosteroid dose in patients with MG. The study ran from August 2004 to October 2006. Initially patients were recruited at 25 neurology centers in the United States Canada United Kingdom Germany and The Netherlands. In 2005 a further 18 centers in Ukraine Israel Spain India Italy France Russia Serbia and Montenegro and Mexico were added because of difficulties in recruiting. All patients gave written informed consent to participate in the study which was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the principles of Good Clinical Practice.Patients.
In the follow-up phase therapy IA  HMP HMP alone oral PSL not exceeding a daily dose of 20 mg or pyridostigmine bromide 60 or 120 mg per day was administered as needed to maintain MM.The endpoint of the follow-up phase therapy was defi ned as 1 year after the beginning of treatment. Effi cacy of FK506 was evaluated by comparison of the number of treatments with IA  HMP or HMP alone during the follow-up phase and the dose of oral PSL per day required at the endpoint between the two groups of patients treated with or without FK506 see table 2 .The protocol for this study was approved by the ethics committee of our institute.Clinical Parameters Clinical classifi cation was performed according to MGFA 13  table 1 . Clinical severity was determined by patients and participating physicians Y.N. D.O. and R.K. not blinded to the treatment type according to MGFA quantitative MG score 13  table 13 . Each patient was assessed by the same physician throughout the course of the present study. The ratios posttreatment to pretreatment of clinical severity score were calculated.
At 1 year into the treatment the PSL dose required was signifi cantly lower for the patients treated with FK506 than for those treated without FK506 p  0.05 table 2 .Laboratory Parameters At 6 months and 1 year into the treatment PBM IL-2production and PBM IL-2 production ratio were more markedly decreased in the patients treated with FK506 than in those treated without FK506 p  0.05 table 3 .Although the mean AChR Ab ratio was signifi cantly decreased in the patients treated without FK506 at 1 . month 6 months and 1 year into the treatment  table 3  it was not decreased in the patients treated with FK506 up to 6 months into the treatment  table 3 . The mean AChR Ab ratio was signifi cantly lower in the patients treated without FK506 than in those treated with FK506 at 1 month p  0.05 table 3  but there was no difference between the two groups at 6 months or 1 year  table 3 .Side Effects FK506 was well tolerated over the 1-year treatmentperiod. The mean concentration of FK506 did not change throughout the study in the patients treated with FK506  table 3 . None of the patients exhibited signifi cant side effects up to 1 year into the treatment.

Moreover CYP3A51/3 and CYP3A51/1 showed a greater effect on dosing interval adjustment than CYP3A53/3. 4 Discussion. To the best of our knowledge this is the first prospective PopPK study of tacrolimus in patients with MG to investigate the effect of demographics pharmacogenetics andconcomitant medications on tacrolimus PopPK parameters. The effects of the CYP3A53 genotype and Wuzhi capsule on tacrolimus clearance were confirmed in the MG population as previously reported 28 29.In our study the estimated typical CL/F value of the population was 17.1L/h which was lower than that reported in renal transplant patients 22.931.8L/h 30 31 and liver transplant patients 21.926.5L/h 27 32. It was comparable to lung transplant patients 17.536.5L/h 33 34 and was higher than that in patients with nephrotic syndrome 10.8 L/h 28 and in healthy populations 10.313.9L/h 3537. The only pharmacokinetic study in the MG population that was previously performed by Chen etal. 20 reported a mean CL/F value of 3.6L/h which isFig. 4 Boxplots of the distributions of simulated tacrolimus trough concentrations for CYP3A51/1 1/3 and 3/3 on 1.5 2 3 4 and 5mg q12h and 3 4 6 8 and 10mg q24h regimens for the non-combined Wuzhi capsule group in MG patients.
After concomitant use of Wuzhi capsules the CL/F of patients with the 1/1 and 1/3 genotype decreased to 18.4L/h and 15.6L/h respectively closer to the CL/F values of 17.1 reported in patients with the 3/3 genotype. A previous study 45 reported that Wuzhi capsules can increase the C0/D of tacrolimus in CYP3A51/1 and 1/3 genotype but has no significant effect on 3/3 genotype. However only one subject with the 3/3 genotype was co-administered with a Wuzhi capsule therefore the influence of Wuzhi capsules on the CYP3A533 genotype could not be evaluated accurately in our study.Genotyping has proven to be effective in predicting the starting dose of tacrolimus 29 46. Based on the final model we developed a dosing regimen for patients with MG with different CYP3A5 genotypes who received tacrolimus with a Wuzhi capsule. There was a significant difference p < 0.05 in the dosage requirements between CYP3A5 expressers and non-expressers. Our analysis showed that with a tacrolimus dosing regimen of 2mg q12h > 75% of subjects with the CYP3A533 genotype could achieve the target tacrolimus C0 of 4.8ng/mL.
Second MG patients on steroids are unlikely to remain disabled. In Pascuzzis series 80% returned to work or usual activities of daily living. Third there is an increased frequency of remissions in MG patients on steroids. Defining remission as no more than minimal eye closure weakness Pascuzzi observed this in 28% of patients. And finally aside from an initial exacerbation of weakness described in what follows MG patients on long-term steroids are unlikely to worsen. Of the patients who significantly improved in the Pascuzzi series and who were followed for up to 17 years only 18% had a subsequent exacerbation which was related mostly to discontinuing or rapidly reducing prednisone. DO THE SIDE EFFECTS AND COSTS OF STEROID TREATMENT OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS. Steroids produce significant side effects Table 2. Within the first few weeks of treatment approximately 50% of patients experience worsening weakness before improvement.9 Exacerbations are more frequent with high-dose daily steroid regimens butalso occur in up to 19% of patients started on low alternate-day doses. Pretreatment with plasmapheresis can prevent or minimize steroid-induced worsening. The long-term side effects of steroids are well known9 but can be minimized.

AC CE PT ED Copyright  2020 The Authors. Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc. on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology. CONCLUSION This updated formal consensus guidance of international MG experts based on new evidence provides recommendations to clinicians caring for MG patients worldwide. Introduction Evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of myasthenia gravis MG have historically been difficult to develop because of limited evidence from studies with a low risk of bias such as large well-designed randomized controlled studies RCTs. To address the lack of uniform globally accepted standards for the care of people with MG the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America MGFA appointed a Task Force in 2013 to develop treatment recommendations for MG. A panel of 15 international experts in the treatment of MG was convened and in 2016 published an international consensus guidance for management of MG. 1 Results of several new trials of MG treatment have been published since that guidance statement was published and in 2019 the panel reviewed the previous recommendations for currency and identified new topics that may affect practice.

BMJ Open 20177e013278. doi10.1136/bmjopen-2016-013278 1Many patients with MG cannot fully participate in social activities due to the effects of the disease and its treatment.4 913 These patients therefore appear to suffer social disadvantages such as unemployment and a decrease in income which can lead to a lower HRQOL.911 13 However information regarding the prevalence of these disadvantages and their detailed associations with MG remains scarce. Therefore we conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire survey to obtain information on social disadvantages experienced by patients with MG. We also examined possible associations with detailed clinical parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients. This study was conducted at 13 neurological centres  Japan MG Registry Group see online supplementary table S1 in Japan. We evaluated patients with established MG between April and July 2015. To avoid potential bias we enrolled consecutive patients with various disease statuses over a short duration 4 months. During this period a total of 1088 patients with MG visited our hospitals. From this group we were able to collect full detailed clinical data from 923 patients and 165 were excluded from the study because of insufficient data collection.
Overall these multivariate regression models picked out similar items to those exhibited univariate correlations with social disadvantages the last paragraph and table 1.Clinical parameters and correlations with social disadvantages The backgrounds of the 917 patients and correlations of clinical parameters with the experience of social disadvantages in applicable patients are shown in table 2. In 680 patients who received income from employment the clinical parameters that exhibited significant positive correlations p<0.0001 r0.15 with experience of unemployment or unwilling job transfer and with experience of a decrease in income were identical these were thymectomy severity at worst condition MGFA classification bulbar symptoms QMG severity at current condition QMG MGC peak dose of PSL and duration of PSL 20 mg/day. Conversely achieving MM or better-5 mg at 1 and 4 years into treatment and at present exhibited significant negative correlations p<0.0001 r0.15. In the 917 patients the clinical parameters that exhibited significant positive correlations p<0.0001 r0.15 with reduced social positivity and activity were female sex severity at worst condition MGFA classification QMG severity at current condition QMG MGC and duration of PSL20 mg/day.
We found that at 4 years into treatment was the most significant time point for achieving MM or better-5 mg in regard to inhibiting experience of unemployment or unwilling job transfer OR 0.61 p0.03 experience of a decrease in income 0.61 0.04 and reduced social positivity and activity 0.49 0.005. Current MG-QOL15-J scores correlated positively with each of these social disadvantages underlined in table 2 suggesting that the current HRQOL of the patients was worse with such experiences. DISCUSSION. The questionnaire results demonstrated that unemployment or an unwilling job transfer after MG onset was experienced by 31.3% of the patients and a decrease in income was experienced by 35.9% among whom 47.1% reported a decrease in total income of more than 50%. In a large German MG cohort 21.0% of the patients experienced hardships in their jobs and 28.3% were forced to retire early due to MG.9 In a study in Thailand the unemployment rate among patients with MG was 2658% and reduced income was seen in 43 48%.10 In a community-based survey of Australian patients with MG 39.4% had been forced to stop working due to MG and 19.4% had to change their occupation.13 Only 40.6% of that cohort were working at the time of the survey and the rest were unable to w.

The rs9324921 A allele was more frequent in the GC insensitive group than in the GC sensitive group P  0.046 OR 1.94. Carriers of the rs17209237 G allele were less frequent in the GC insensitive group than in the GC sensitive group dominant model P  0.009. Carriers of the rs9324921 A allele were more frequent in the GC insensitive group than in the GC sensitive group dominant model P  0.037. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that the rs17209237 G allele carrier P  0.037 OR 0.12 and disease duration before GC treatment P  0.011 OR 3.45 were independent factors that contributed to GC efficacy. Conclusion rs17209237 in the GR gene was identified as an independent factor that contributes to GC efficacy in MG patients. The genetic variations of the GR gene may play a role in predicting response to GC treatment. Introduction.

Although SFEMG is widely accepted as a sensitive diagnostic tool in the evaluation of patients with neuromuscular junction disorders there is little data regarding the use of SFEMG as a measure of disease severity and response to treatment Howard and Sanders 1981 Konishi et al. 1981. As part of a therapeutic trial of mycophenolate mofetil MM in MG Meriggioli et al. in press we performed SFEMG studies before and after treatment with MM or placebo. METHODS end. We conducted a randomized double blind placebocontrolled therapeutic trial of MM in suboptimally controlled MG and the full results of that study are in press Meriggioli et al. in press. One of the secondary measures of efficacy was the magnitude of the change in mean jitter comparing baseline values to values obtained after 5 months on the study drug.

This does not appear to be the explanation for the findings in patient 13 because the percentage of fiber pairs with neuromuscular failure actually increased in this patient. Thus despite evidence of improved clinical function the physiologic abnormality in the tested muscle actually worsened.
disease end. And we are left to wonder whether this particular moment is a call to arms or a battle lost in the war for practicing medicine based on best available evidence in conjunction with clinical experience and acumen. Myasthenia gravis exacerbation after discontinuing mycophenolate. Objective To determine whether discontinuation or marked reduction of mycophenolate mofetil MMF in patients with myasthenia gravis MG causes MG exacerbations. Methods We identified 88 patients with MG who took MMF during the 5-year period 20072011 at our MG clinic. We then performed detailed chart reviews and recorded all MG exacerbations and their relationship to MMF and other treatment changes. We also recorded demographic data and disease characteristics including antibody status and Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America status. Results There were 14 patients who had an MG exacerbation during the study period. Of these 13 had discontinued MMF therapy with a median time until exacerbation of 16 weeks after discontinuation 9 patients or marked dose reduction 4 patients of MMF therapy exacerbation in the absence of change in any other component of the immunosuppressive regimen.
However supportive evidence from transplant patients hasbeen lacking as it is uncommon for individuals older than 80 years old to be candidates for transplantation.Given that MMF could trigger some viral infections particularly in elderly patients with MG we suggest taking precautions and monitor for these infections particularly in elderly MG patients and also weighing the risk of potentially life threatening infection versus the beneficial effect of MMF immunosuppression. It is not known also whether testing for CMV serology should be done on all MG patients prior to starting MMF. Since prophylactic regimen for CMV infection has been utilized in transplant patients it is not clear also whether the use of prophylactic antiviral agents in MG patients particularly the elderly ones or those with positive CMV serology treated with MMF is beneficial. Leflunomide treatment in corticosteroid-dependent myasthenia gravis an open-label pilot study. Leflunomide is an effective drug used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Here we report the findings of an open-label pilot study which found that leflunomide is also an effective treatment for myasthenia gravis MG. This study recruited 15 corticosteroid-dependent MG patients.

With this review we can add up the score card and although the team has not beaten MG there are goals being scored. Competing interests. The authors declare no competing interests. Long-term efficacy and side effects of low-dose tacrolimus for the treatment of Myasthenia Gravis. The study evaluated the efficacy of low-dose tacrolimus for treating Myasthenia Gravis MG. Data were collected from 97 patients treated with low-dose tacrolimus from February 2011 to April 2015.
Additional two cases withdrew during the between the 24 and 36 month follow-up period after achieving complete stable remission. Metabolic-genetic analysis. A total of 39 patients were screened for the CYP3A53 genotype of which 1 2.56% was found to possess wildtype CYP3A51/1 18 46.1% had heterozygote CYP3A51/3 and 20 51.2% had mutant homozygote CYP3A53/3. Patients with wild-type and heterozygote and thus fast metabolism received tacrolimus doses of 2.60  0.99 2.36  1.17 1.91  1.45 and 3.00  1.00 mg respectively for the first year through fourth year. Patients with the mutant homozygote and thus slow metabolism received 2.44  0.89 1.90  1.29 1.33  1.14 and 2.50  0.71 mg respectively for the first year through fourth year. Since only 5 patients 3 with fast metabolism and 2 with slow metabolism who underwent metabolic analysis completed the full 4 year followup we compared the dose of tacrolimus of between the slow n  15 and fast metabolic groups n  14 using a 2 year follow-up period and no statistically significant difference was found Fig. 1. end. Follow-up.
It is clear that Th1 and Th17 cells are involved in promoting MG immunopathology and T cell targeted therapies such as tacrolimus may enhance treatment efficacy. Given tacrolimus mechanism of action against T cell responses we hypothesized that tacrolimus would suppress the Th1 and Th17 responses that are enhanced in MuSK-MG.Prior studies in AChR-MG patients suggest that trough concentrations of> 4.8 ng/mL or 7-8 ng/mL have been associated with favorable clinical outcomes Kanai et al. 2017 Ponseti et al. 2005. Our study supports that similar concentrations 10 ng/mL have profoundinhibitory effects on proinflammatory Th1 and Th17 responses while Th2 cells are not significantly affected. This suggests that future studies in MuSK-MG patients could use a similar drug concentration target to guide therapy.Th17 cells can be subdivided into pathogenic and non-pathogenic Th17 cells based on their cytokine profile Lee et al. 2012 Stockinger and Omenetti 2017. Pathogenic Th17 cells are implicated in experimental models of autoimmunity and more recently in human disease Hu et al. 2017.

Case Report This is a case report of a patient with severe and refractory myasthenia gravis MG who followed a high-dose vitamin D treatment a massive-dose treatment 80 000 to 120 000 IU/day promoted by a medical center in Brazil but still not proven and she had her first complete remission after this type of treatment with increased vitamin D serum levels 400 to 700 ng/mL. Conclusions This case report may reinforce the reported correlation between vitamin D level and disease severity and introduces a possible new use for vitamin D as a potential target for treating autoimmune diseases. We recommend large double-blind placebo-controlled randomized studies using high-dose vitamin D treatment for refractory autoimmune diseases to reliably assess this pharmacotherapy target for these diseases.

Summary end. A neuromuscular blocking drug NMBD induced neuromuscular blockade NMB in patients with myasthenia gravis usually dissipates either spontaneously or by administration of neostigmine. We administered sugammadex to a patient with myasthenia gravis to reverse a rocuronium-induced profound NMB. NMBDs predispose such patients to severe postoperative residual paralysis and respiratory complications. Sugammadex binds steroidal NMBDs and therefore reverses a rocuronium or vecuronium-induced NMB without interfering with cholinergic transmission. A rapid and complete recovery from profound NMB was achieved and no adverse events were observed. This case suggests that sugammadex is a safe and effective antagonist of a rocuronium induced NMB blockade in patients with myasthenia gravis. Key words. Myasthenia gravis. Sugammadex. Rocuronium.

This treatment regimen also reduces the amount of PCT measured ocular deviation in primary and downward gaze. The immediate and long term benefit also occurred in patients who failed pyridostigmine alone. Prednisone decreased the frequency of ptosis in one or both upper lids from 56.4% to 16.3% at 1 month and to 15.8% atwww.bjophthalmol.com2 years. Our results contrast with those reported for childhood OMG where only 29% of 24 patients treated with unspecified doses of prednisone pyridostigmine or both for an unspecified time improved ocular motility.12 In the current study the frequency of maintaining improved ocular motor and lid function might have been higher if the prednisone dose was reduced more slowly as is recommended for controlling systemic muscle weakness.13 We reduced the prednisone dose quickly to avoid adverse effects. Some benefit was probably gained by the combination of pyridostigmine and prednisone. Our failure rate of 12.3% contrasts with Evolis study where 6/18 33% failed to improve ocular motor function with prednisone 2550 mg alternate day therapy.7 In fact of our eight failures only four 6.1% failed to improve with moderate doses.
Seronegative MG predominantly involves the ocular muscles and has a milder disease course than seropositive MG 1425.This appears to be especially true in male subjects which may be related to the immunomodulatory effects of testosterone 25.Myasthenia gravis may be congenital or drug-induced penicillamine can induce a myasthenic syndrome 4. Intracranial lesions can masquerade as MG or occur in conjunction with it 132128. Usually parasellar tumors or aneurysms these lesions may produce fluctuating ptosis and a positive response to Tensilon. Thus patients with signs and symptoms limited to the ocular muscles may need a neuroimaging study. Other conditions such as hyperthyroidism Graves disease multiple sclerosis Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome botulism Guillain-Barre syndrome amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and progressive external ophthalmoplegia are usually readily distinguished by the temporal course of the illness associated sensory or autonomic symptoms and/or by systemic symptoms not seen with isolated MG 417.To our knowledge there are no published reports on the participation of myasthenic male or female subjects in organi. zed athletics. In part this reflects the fact that MG was often disabling or fatal in the past even with the use of anticholinesterases.

mbenatarmed.miami.eduEfficacy of Prednisone in the Treatment of Ocular Myasthenia EPITOME is a multicenter randomized double blind placebo-controlled trial that is being conducted under the auspices of the Muscle Study Group. EPITOME is the first randomized control trial in patients with ocular myasthenia and aims to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of prednisone over a period of four months in patients with newly diagnosed ocular myasthenia whose symptoms have failed to remit in response to a trial of cholinesterase inhibitor therapy.Keywords ocular myasthenia steroids clinical trial evidence-based medicine. Introduction. Myasthenia gravis is a generalized disorder that often manifests initially as focal weakness. The most common focal presentation is ocular with weakness involving the extraocular muscles eyelid levators and orbicularis oculi. The two leading ocular symptoms are ptosis and diplopia.
A high daily dosage of prednisone relative to body weight was found to be neither a predictor of exacerbation nor a predictor of early improvement in bivariate correlation analysis. Steroid-induced exacerbation in MG is a frequently encountered and challenging problem. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of exacerbation of MG when prescribing prednisone especially when treating elderly bulbar dominant or severely myasthenic patients. 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Although oral corticosteroids are effective for the treatment of myasthenia gravis MG the possibility of steroid-induced exacerbation of symptoms especially during the initial course of steroid therapy has limited their use patients with severe MG. However the factors influencing or predicting in exacerbation are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to identify the clinical factors that predict the initial paradoxical exacerbation of MG in response to steroid therapy. Fifty-five consecutive patients who were administered for the first time high doses of prednisone 4080 mg in a tertiary medical centre in Seoul were included.
However paradoxical exacerbation of MG by prednisone is also a well-known phenomenon especially during the initial course of therapy.35 The reported frequency of prednisone-induced exacerbation varies between 25% and 75%.71112 A wide range of severities of exacerba-0967-5868/ - see front matter 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Kim.tion have also been reported varying between mild aggravation of weakness to death from respiratory failure.67Prednisone is usually used as a secondary agent in combination therapy for MG when symptoms cannot be adequately controlled with anti-cholinesterase agent monotherapy. Accordingly it is likely that prednisone-induced exacerbation is a frequent problem for clinicians who prescribe prednisone for anti-cholinesterase-resistant MG. Thus factors that provoke prednisone-induced exacerbation and methods that can prevent or minimize prednisone-induced exacerbation are topics of great relevance to clinicians. However until recently no published studies concerning MG have focused on these issues.The current study was designed to determine the incidence and clinical features of prednisone-induced exacerbation.
A dissociation between plasma cortisol and corticotropin levels has also been previously demonstrated in response to both psychological and physiological stress.24 Although corticotropin continues to be the dominant factor playing a significant modulating influence on the axis arginine vasopressin endotheline25 macrophage-migration factor26 and a variety of cytokines such as IL-627 have also been included as factors. Simon28 reported that treatment with corticotropin had a beneficial effect in MG in 1935. In a study of more than 100 patients with severe refractory MG who were given corticotropin good improvement was reported.29 Consequently we observed a significant negative correlation between cortisol levels in plasma and daily dosage of PSL r  j0.38 P  0.03 Fig. 3B end. Both corticotropin and cortisol concentrations in the PSL group were significantly lower than those in the PSLj group Fig. 1 end. However the corticotropin and cortisol levels of the MG patients were not lower than the reference range for the healthy subjects during GC therapy. In MG patients who were treated with PSL there was a significantly negative correlation between the anxiety/insomnia scores evaluated by GHQ-28 and corticotropin levels in plasma r  j0.47 P  0.023 Fig. 7B end.
Statistical methods. The nonparametric MannWhitney test was used for assessment of mean values in continuous variables of independent samples including seasonal variations in 25 OHD values. Spearmans rank order correlations were applied to measure associations between two continuous variables. Related samples Wilcoxon signed rank test was applied to calculate differences in 25OHD level and MGC before and after therapeutic supplementation with vitamin D3.

Patients with LRP4 antibody positivity tend to have a milder disease course compared with AChR or anti-MuSKpositive patients and can present with isolated ocular symptoms 3134. LRP4 should therefore be tested in patients who carry a suspicion of OMG if the AChR antibodies are negative.Muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibodiesMuSK-antibodies are present in 110% of all patients with myasthenia gravis 3536  and are more prevalent in women and patients of Mediterranean decent 2831. Among patients with generalized myasthenia gravis and negative serologies to AChR antibodies 2040% will be positive for antiMuSK antibodies 3237. MuSK antibodies bind to an extracellular domain and cause a reduction in the postsynaptic density of AChR 3 . Isolated ocular involvement is rare in patients with anti-MUSK antibodies which tend to have severe systemic weakness and be more symptomatic of bulbar and facial muscle weakness 38 . A retrospective review of 82 patients with positive anti-MuSK antibody showed that 3/82 patients presented with isolated ocular involvement. Anti-MuSK-positive patients with generalized myasthenia gravis had a similar incidence of ophthalmic findings compared with AChR-positive patients but involvement of the extraocular muscles seemed to be milder and less frequent 39.

An improvement induced by PE may be used as a predictor of those patients who are likely to benefit from steroids. High-dose intravenous gamma globulin is also likely to provide short-term benefit and is often used in lieu of PE.In conclusion immune treatments including corticosteroids facilitate the management of many patients disabled with ocular myas-thenia as well as those who demonstrate subclinical evidence of generalized MG. In addition immune treatment in patients with mild disease seems to protect patients from developing more severe generalized disease. Each patient however needs to be evaluated on an individual and continual basis. Thymectomy carries less potential for adverse effects than corticosteroids and consequently should be the first line of immune treatment in ocular MG. Children and the elderly are particularly susceptible to developing corticosteroid complications. Thymectomy PE and intravenous gamma globulin represent alternative immune treatments to corticosteroids in these high-risk patients.Accepted for publication October 20 1999.Corresponding author Mark A.

Iron saturation was low in 37 patients 78.8%. Of these 37 patients only 10 27.0% had anemia. Our data demonstrate abnormally low serum iron 62.5% and iron saturation 77.1% levels in relatively large proportions of patients with RLS. Anemia 21.2% and reduced ferritin 25.0% were found in comparatively smaller proportions. These findings confirm the relation between abnormalities of serum iron status and RLS. Although reduced serum iron and reduced serum iron saturation are characteristic of iron deficiency these findings are not specific for the cndi t ion . Ferritin is considered to be a more reliable indicator of iron defiiency.. These observations raise an important question regarding the basis for the abnormalities of serum iron status we detected. It is possible that the reduced serum iron and iron saturation measurements in RLS are not indicative of simple iron deficiency but reflect some more pervasive and as yet unidentified defect of iron transport or metabolism. Iron is a component of the dopamine D-2 and p-opiate r e c e p t o r    . both of which are RLS treatment targets suggesting a potential mechanism by which a defect in iron metabolism may be involved in the generation of RLS.

every other day. However because her osteoporosis became more severe 6 months previously a switch had been made from PSL to tacrolimus 3 mg daily and her symptoms had continued to remain under control. Because her blood eosinophil count had recently risen in the absence of any precipitating cause the increase was suspected of being drug-induced and tacrolimus was stopped. However when she broke out in a rash 2 weeks later a drug eruption was suspected and she was referred to our department. Physical examination showed widespread purpura on her lower legs Fig. 1a end. Laboratory test revealed hypereosinophilia 7.82 9 10/l with elevated IgE 901 IU/ml normal up to 173 and high titers of rheumatoid factor 82 IU/ml normal 010. Myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody MPO-ANCA was negative and anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody showed an increased value of 48 nmol/l normal up to 0.2. Skin biopsy showed necrotizing vasculitis with a marked eosinophilic infiltration. CSS was diagnosed and when treatment with tacrolimus 3 mg daily was resumed the eruption almost completely resolved in 1 week Fig. 1b end. CSS is rare with prevalence of 10.713 per million inhabitants 1 whereas the prevalence of MG is 50 per million inhabitants 2.
In general many kinds of autoimmune diseases can be associated with MG 5. Among them PM is relatively rare 5 6 7 and invasive thymoma is frequently concomitant as an underlying disease in cases of PM associated with MG 8. Invasive thymoma is probably related to the pathogenesis of both PM and MG and this patient was successfully treated with surgical removal of invasive thymoma and oral prednisolone as shown in previous reports 8 9 10.On readmission to our hospital 15 years after onset of the disease the main cause of muscle weakness with myalgia was considered to be PM on the basis of an increase in serum levels of muscular enzymes including CK and inflammatory markers. Anti-AchR antibodies in serum remained at a low level and there was no apparent clinical evidence suggesting a recurrence of MG. Although the patient was at first treated with lowdose hydrocortisone for adrenocortical insufficiency ascribable to cessation of long-term oral prednisolone the muscle weakness and myalgia persisted. In the treatment for recurrence of PM oral prednisolone is usually employed as the first-line drug 11 12 13. In this patient however multiple bone fractures ascribable to long-term oral prednisolone were present and this drug could not be used again for treatment.
When muscular symptoms due to PM are resistant to these drugs other immunomodulatory treatments such as high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin can also be considered as a therapeutic option 19 20. As this patient sometimes showed the reappearance of myasthenic symptoms tacrolimus was selected from among these candidate drugs because of its effectiveness also in MG 21 22 23 particularly in thymectomized patients following the guidelines approved by the Ministry of Public Health and Welfare of Japan. This drug is classified among immunosuppressive agents acting as calcineurin inhibitors and reversibly and strongly suppresses cytokine production mainly from helper T cells such as cyclosporin A 24. In this patient tacrolimus was used for the treatment of PM but also to prevent the recurrence of. MG. end. At present there is only one clinical report demonstrating the efficacy of tacrolimus in the treatment of refractory PM 25. According to this report all cases showed improvement of muscle weakness in parallel with normalization of CK in serum within 6 months of the initiation of tacrolimus. In this patient also the serum level of CK returned to a normal value 3 months after initiation of tacrolimus and muscle strength gradually recovered in 6 months.
Therefore TDM and CYP3A53 genetic polymorphism is warranted for tacrolimus dosing adjustment to optimize the treatment for patients with MG.References for online-only E-extra publication1 Cruz JL Wolff ML Vanderman AJ et al.The emerging role of tacrolimus in myasthenia gravis J.Ther Adv Neurol Disord. 20158292-103.2 Kanai T Uzawa A Kawaguchi N et al.

It appears advantageous to prevent GMG during the first year since the risk of developing GMG decreases when the duration of OMG exceeds 1 year and is even lower after 2 years. One of our patients who required 5 mg of prednisone every three days to prevent severe ophthalmoplegia stopped the medication after 3 years and developed GMG 4 years later. Prednisone treatment has a dual purpose restoring ocular function and reducing deterioration to GMG. We do not know whether low-dose prednisone would be effective once GMG has developed. Without a randomized trial which multiple authors 1316 and the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology have already asked for 12 this observational study appears to provide the only available data and suggests that early intervention with low doses of steroid therapy favorably alters the natural history of this disorder and both delays and reduces the frequency of GMG. However continued corticosteroid therapy appears to be needed in most cases.Acknowledgment This work was financially supported by Alice and Richard Netter the David B.

Introduction There have been reports of a lower rate of OMGApproximately 50% of all acquired myasthenia gravis patients present with ocular symptoms of ptosis and/or diplopia with no clinical evidence of bulbar respiratory or limb muscle weakness 16. Of those patients with ocular myasthenia gravis OMG about 5060% will subsequently develop generalized myasthenia gravis GMG with 80% progressing within the first year and 90% within 3 years 157. About 10% will have episodes of spontaneous remission and be symptom-free 15.

Six men and nine women with a mean of 45.6 years S.D. 14.6 range 2872 gave written consent to participate in a prospective open-label study. The study protocol was approved by the local institutional review board and authorised by the Spanish health authorities AEM protocol 02-0081 code MG/601200-T. All patients had undergone transsternal extended thymectomy at least in the previous 3 years and were under treatment with prednisone mean dose 33.1 mg/day range 1060 and cyclosporin 23 mg/kg per day plasma levels 80120 ng/mL. Histological findings included hyperplasia of the thymus in seven patients encapsulated thymoma Masaoka stage I in three and invasive thymoma in five Masaoka stage III 4 stage IVa 1. According to the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America MGFA clinical classification5 all patients had muscle weakness affecting other than ocular muscles class IIIa moderate weakness predominantly affecting limb axial muscles or both 2 patients class IIIb moderate weakness predominantly affecting oropharyngeal respiratory muscles or both 10 patients and class IVb severe weakness predominantly affecting oropharyngeal respiratory muscles or both 3 patients.
Most of these are case reports and retrospective case series. After a comprehensive search we selected five studies consisting of a retrospective analysis of the main features of LOMG patients Table 1. The review in the literature reveals a scarce number of cases of MG beginning after age 85 and only anecdotal cases with onset after 90 years 25. We report the case of a 93-year-old female patient presenting with generalized muscle weakness dysphagia diplopia and bilateral palpebral ptosis with anti-AchRs and RNS studies compatible with a myasthenia gravis. The introduction of targeted therapy resulted in significant clinical improvement. Despite typical clinical presentation there was a 2-month delay in the diagnosis. Age-associated changes multimorbidity and the possibility of an alternate diagnosis are possible explanations for the delay in diagnosis. Recognition of LOMG is essential because of its diagnostic and therapeutic implications in the elderly population. Comparing LOMG with early-onset MG it appears that LOMG has a male predominance a lower  Renato Oliveira renato.silva.oliveirahospitaldaluz.pt.
The immune-regulatory effect of vitamin D is known to inhibit effector T cells directly and also induce Treg to decrease the production of inflammatory cytokines. Both vitamin D and Treg might be critical for T cell regulation 34. Previous studies have shown that vitamin D levels are low in patients with autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis 57. However there are few studies on vitamin D status in autoimmune neuromuscular diseases.The aims of this study were to evaluate serum levels of 125 OH2D and 25OHD in patients with MG and healthy controlsand the association of vitamin D levels with clinical severity and treatment status. 2 end. Methods end. end. 2.1 end. Subjects end. We reviewed data from the MG registry of Jeju National University Hospital and selected MG patients without taking vitamin D supplementation. We identified 34 patients and 9 patients refused to participate in the study. A total of 25 patients were ultimately enrolled. Diagnostic criteria of MG included clinical muscle fatigue and decremental response on repetitive nerve stimulation test in conjunction with the presence of AChR antibodies. We only enrolled MG patients with anti-AChR antibodies AChR-MG.

Five patients 20% showed insufficient levels of 25OHD but all healthy controls had sufficient 25OHD levels Fig. 1 end. Among 5 patients having insufficient 25OHD levels four had immunosuppressive agents. 3.3 end. Association between vitamin D and clinical severity and treatment status. In AChR-MG patients levels of 125OH2D did not significantly differ between ocular mean 50.9  28.7 ng/mL and generalized MG mean 48.6  25.7 ng/mL. Similarly levels of 25OHD did not differ between two groups ocular 17.2  4.9 ng/mL generalized 19.8  10.1 ng/mL. There is no significant difference in vitamin D levels between early and late onset MG patients. In addition levels of 125OH2D and 25OHD did not significantly differ between AChR-MG patients under immunosuppressive therapy and taking anti-cholinesterase only Table 2.
As many patients with MG are taking corticosteroid it seems reasonable to evaluate the vitamin D status in order to reduce the risk of osteoporosis. In addition no correlation was observed between vitamin D levels and clinical severity and onset of age. Although it is known that MGC scale is a valid instrument for measuring clinical status of patients with MG 25OHD levels did not correlate with myasthenic weakness measured by MGC score.Vitamin D exerts its biological function not only by influencing cellular processes directly but also by influencing gene expression via the vitamin D receptor. Vitamin D receptor expression was noted in the CNS Schwann cells muscles and peripheral neurons 17. Previous studies have revealed the role of vitamin D in several neurological disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis multiple sclerosis Alzheimers disease Parkinsons disease and stroke 71821. However study about a potential role of vitamin D in autoimmune neuromuscular disorders is lacking. The timing of vitamin D deficiency and its effects on disease risk the tissuespecific consequences of vitamin D deficiency on gene expression and the regional influence of vitamin D status in neurological disorders are key issues to be addressed.
ting the disease process of MG specifically through T- and B-lymphocytes.35. Mycophenolate Mofetil Treatment of Myasthenia Gravis. William D Cahoon Jr and Denise R KocklerDrug Information RoundsAuthor information provided at the end of the text.OBJECTIVE To review published literature evaluating the effectiveness of mycophenolate mofetil for the treatment of myasthenia gravis MG.DATA SOURCES Searches of MEDLINE 1966August 2005 and Cochrane Database 1993August 2005 were conducted. Studies conducted in humans and published in English were retrieved. Additional data were identified through subsequent bibliographic reviews.DATA SYNTHESIS Interruption of T- and B-lymphocyte proliferation in various autoimmune diseases has been investigated. Mycophenolate is known to inhibit lymphocyte proliferation and has shown improved clinical responses in several autoimmune diseases including lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis and systemic vasculitis. Data suggesting similar benefits in MG treatment have been reported in case reports retrospective analyses an open-label trial and a randomized double-blind trial.CONCLUSIONS Limited evidence from retrospective analyses and clinical trials suggests that mycophenolate is a possible treatment option for patients with MG.
These recommendations are outlined and discussed further in a recent editorial 2. These guidelines recommend that patients should be considered for osteoporosis prevention if their daily prednisolone dose is over 7.5 mg for 6 months a total dose of 1.35 g or more in 6 months. In those over the age of 65 years and those whose daily dose exceeds 15 mg for 6 months a total dose of 2.7 g osteoporosis treatment is recommended from onset. In younger patients with daily doses between 7.5 and 15 mg it is suggested that other risk factors such as premature menopause family history of fractures slender build and immobility should be considered. The guidelines suggest using bisphosphonates although another editorial mentions the small yet important risk of side effects the financial cost and the lack of information on long-term treatment 3. Patients with myasthenia gravis are a group of neurological patients who take corticosteroids often for prolonged periods 4. We undertook a retrospective review of patients with myasthenia gravis to determine how often osteoporosis prophylaxis would be indicated on the basis of these guidelines.
The guidelines suggest using bisphosphonates although another editorial mentions the small yet important risk of side effects the financial cost and the lack of information on long-term treatment 3.Patients with myasthenia gravis are a group of neurological pa-tients who take corticosteroids often for prolonged periods 4. We undertook a retrospective review of patients with myasthenia gravis to determine how often osteoporosis prophylaxis would be indicated on the basis of these guidelines. We reviewed the records of all 17 patients 11 men and 6 women with myasthenia gravis patients presenting to the Neurology Department at Gloucester and Cheltenham Hospital catchment population 550000 over a 5-year period. These included 4 with ocular myasthenia and 13 with generalized myasthenia 15 of whom were treated with oral prednisolone 3/4 with the ocular form and 12/13 with the generalized form. In the 15 patients treated with corticosteroids the mean total dose of prednisolone over the first 6 months was 4.6 g range 1.87.7 in those with ocular myasthenia 2.8 g range 1.83.5 and in those with generalized myasthenia 5.1 g range 2.17.7. Twelve of these had a total prednisolone dose over 6 months of more than 2.7 g equivalent to a daily dose of 15 mg.
This corticosteroid dosage was comparable to that reported in other studies. The daily prednisolone dose at 12 months in our patients was 225 mg. This compares with a median dose of 17.522.5 mg at 12 months in patients at tertiary referral centres 4.On the basis of the guidelines all patients who received corticos-teroids for myasthenia gravis needed osteoporosis prophylaxis 12 because they received an average dose of 15 mg or more and 3 with a dose between 7.5 mg and 15 mg because of additional risk factors. Treatment was initiated in this cohort of patients prior to the publication of the guidelines. Despite this however 11 of 15 were given osteoporosis prophylaxis with biphophonate treatment.On the basis of this retrospective review all myasthenia gravis patients started on prednisolone fulfilled the current guidelines for osteoporosis prophylaxis indicating that most patients in this situation should be started on osteoporosis prophylaxis treatment at the onset.

Anaesthesia and surgery in patients with Myaesthenia Gravis is associated with an increased incidence of complications including post operative ventilation. We report the successful use of intra-operative train of four ratio monitoring and Sugammadex to reverse rocuronium induced neuromuscular blockade in an elderly octagenarian with Myaesthenia Gravis undergoing an emergency laporotomy. Case report An 87 year old man with Myaesthenia Gravis underwent an emergency laporotomy for a perforated sigmoid diverticulum. Induction of anaesthesia was performed with 100 g of fentanyl 120 mg propofol and 25 mg rocuronium. Intraoperative boluses of 5 mg rocuronium were guided by train of four ratio of 50%. At the end of the procedure 4 mg/kg of Sugammadex was given to reverse neuromuscular blockade as observed by return of four twitches on the train of four. He was then successfully extubated and did not require any post operative ventilation. Conclusion We report the successful use of intra-operative neuromuscular monitoring and Sugammadex to reverse rocuronium inducedneuromuscular blockade in an elderly octagenarianwithMyaestheniaGravis undergoing emergency laporotomy. 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction Mycophenolate mofetil MMF is frequently used to treat myasthenia gravis but there is little information to guide clinicians on the safety of reducing the dose in well-controlled patients. Methods This retrospective chart review at 3 institutions identified 92 patients who had undergone MMF taper after achieving either pharmacologic remission or minimal manifestations status. Statistical analysis was performed to assess differences in patient characteristics between patients who had successfully tapered MMF and those who relapsed. Results Of 92 patients undergoing a taper 30 relapsed. The relapses were mild transient and usually responded to increased MMF dose. MG crisis did not occur. The mean dose at time of relapse was 888 mg/day. Patients with relapses were tapered more quickly 8.4 vs. 62.4 months. Conclusions Tapering MMF appears safe after years of disease stability. Reducing the dose at a dose of only 500 mg/day every 12 months is recommended. Muscle Nerve 52 211215 2015 Immunosuppression is often necessary to improve weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis MG. Effective treatment in MG should achieve maximum muscle strength function and quality of life with minimal associated treatment side effects.
Three patients 43% had previously failed other immunosuppressants. The initial MGFA classrecorded for the group was 2.71 6 1.1 whereas the worst MGFA class was 3.0 6 0.8.Patients had been taking MMF for a mean of 4.2 6 1.3 years range 26 years before initiating a taper. The mean daily maximum MMF dose in this group was 1642 mg 6 627 mg median 2000 mg range 50022000 mg. The observed taper occurred over a mean of 42.8 months range 25107 months. Mean follow-up at the lowest recorded dose was 22.8 months range 1254 months.When compared with those patients who were able to lower MMF doses but not completely discontinue medication a few differences were seen. There was a nearly significant trend toward shorter duration of MG before starting MMF 2.3 vs. 4.5 years P 5 0.06. These patients also had a lower maximum daily MMF dose 1642 vs. 2344 mg P 5 0.02 and a shorter duration of MMF treatment before starting the taper 4.2 vs. 5.9 years P 5 0.01. This subgroup was too small to draw conclusions but starting MMF earlier in their disease course may have resulted in a better outcome.Failed MMF Tapers. Thirty patients failed in their attempts to taper MMF 13 Mayo Clinic 1 University of Virginia and 16 Duke University. Of these 18 60% were men and 12 40% were women.
Most patients were antibody positiveUse of MMF in MG MUSCLE  NERVE August 2015 21380% had acetylcholine receptor antibodies and 7% had MuSK antibodies. Twelve patients 40% had undergone thymectomy with data on pathology in 10 of 12 4 thymoma 2 thymic hyperplasia 1 thymic atrophy 3 normal. Two of the patients with thymoma received radiation therapy after resection. Mean duration of MG before starting MMF was 3.74 6 4.6 years range 0.089.75 years. Ten patients 33% had previously failed other immunosuppressant therapies. The highest MGFA class recorded for the group was 2.80 6 1.16 range 15 Table 1. Nine patients 30% were taking prednisone at the time of taper failure. The mean daily dose was 8.9 6 5 mg/day median 7.5 mg range 520 mg at the time of MMF failure.Patients who failed MMF taper had been taking MMF for a mean of 4.39 6 2.6 years before initiating a taper. The mean maximum MMF dose in this group was 2216 6 387 mg/day range 1000 3000 mg/day. The mean taper duration time from first to last MMF dose change was 8.4 months range 0224 months. The mean dose at which MG relapse occurred was 888 6 755 mg/day median 1000 mg/day range 03000 mg/day. Mean time to relapse on that dose was 8.13 6 10.1 months median 4 months range 0.518 months.
l educations. Therefore infection with this parasite may be neglected by clinicians. 2 laboratory negligence stool examination is usually requested for the detection of intestinal parasites which is routinely performed through wet direct smear or rarely by concentration method both with lower sensitivity compared to agar plate test for the detection of chronic infections with S. stercoralis and 3 lack of guideline for the screening of S. stercoralis in patients under therapy with immunosuppressive agents. Infection with S. stercoralis may be identified during the advanced stage of hyper-infection when it is too late for anti-parasite treatment and therefore with high mortality as observed in our case reported here.Although S. Stercoralis is reported to be the major parasitic agent for the appearance of eosinophilia in clinical cases in Guilan province 13 nevertheless no eosinophilia was found in our patient who showed a large number of S. stercoralis larvae in both stool and sputum examinations. The low rate of eosinophilia in hyper-infection or disseminated strongyloidiasis is attributed to the suppressive effect of corticosteroids 14. It is proposed that corticosteroids induce the hyper-infection of S.
All cases of unspecified upper respiratory infections were included in the vaccine nonpreventable infectionsVNPI group.Specific cautioned medications listed in the MGFA Drugs to avoid or use with caution in MG list are referred to as medications to avoid or be used with caution in patients with MG MAUC-MG.12At the institution from which our study subjects were selected each patient was given a recommendation to receive the pneumococcal pneumonia and annual influenza vaccinations before treatment. Each patient diagnosed with MG went through medication reconciliation was educated on pharmaceutical contributors to acute MG exacerbations and was provided with the aforementioned MGFA list. Records were reviewed to determine instances of prescriptions for MAUC-MG patients without an established neuromuscular specialist without neuromuscular specialist consultation or without established initial care at this institution. 2.2  Exacerbation categorization.
Treatment with methylprednisolone for myasthenia gravis was associated with a marked decrease in both biochemical markers of bone formation and resorption without any changes in endogenous cAMP and serum levels of calcium PTH and 125dihydroxyvitamin D3 125-OH2D3. These findings suggest that the possible pathogenesis of hypercalcemia in primary hyperparathyroidism may be attributed to the increased calcium reabsorption in the kidney and the increased intestinal calcium absorption as a result of stimulated production of 125-OH2D3 in the kidney. It thus follows that the renal tubular effect rather than the skeletal effect of the PTH excess may play a pivotal role in the development of hypercalcemia in primary hyperparathyroidism.

1 end. Ten months after initiating the combined treatment the disseminated thymoma had almost disappeared Fig. 1 October 2005.Tacrolimus may be an effective agent for myasthenia gravis and disseminated thymoma. However it should be administered with caution due to its potential toxic effects such as cardiomyopathy nephrotoxicity and hematological disorders when given in high doses 6.In summary we presented a rare case with pleural dissemination of a thymoma that was reduced by treatments with corticosteroids and tacrolimus. Moderate doses of corticosteroids with tacrolimus may in some cases be an effective procedure for pleural dissemination of thymoma and such treatment should be undertaken on a trial basis for patients not indicated for surgery radiotherapy or chemotherapy. 4 end.

Case ReportzzWe report herein the case of a 56-year-old woman with MG aggravated by the activation of isolated mediastinal tuberculous lymphadenitis MTL during corticosteroid administration. The possibility of MTL had been disregarded in the differential diagnosis of aggravation of MG weakness because MTL without pulmonary manifestations is uncommon even in areas where tuberculosis is endemic. 224 Copyright  2010 Korean Neurological AssociationPrint ISSN 1738-6586 / On-line ISSN 2005-5013 10.3988/jcn.2010.6.4.224 CASE REPORT J Clin Neurol 20106224-226.

Additional lesions may arise on the nasolabial folds glabella periocular skin and eyelids.15 Facial flushing and comedones are notably absent. Classically perioral dermatitis develops secondary to the use of topical corticosteroids or facial cosmetics.1 Young women age 1645 years are most often affected although cases involving children and men have been reported.12 Treatment requires cessation of the offending agent with or without the addition of antibiotics such as tetracycline or erythromycin.15 Without adequate treatment the disease tends to run a persistent and fluctuating course. While perioral dermatitis has been closely associated with topical corticosteroid use the emergence of this condition in patients taking systemic corticosteroids has rarely been reported in the literature.6We report a 37-year-old woman with no significant past medical history who was admitted following 2 days of generalized muscle weakness blurry vision difficulty swallowing and voice changes. She was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis MG following a positive edrophonium test single fibre electromyography that demonstrated severe dysfunction at the neuromuscular junction and positive anti-MuSK antibody. Antibodies against skeletal muscle and acetylcholine receptor binding were negative.
