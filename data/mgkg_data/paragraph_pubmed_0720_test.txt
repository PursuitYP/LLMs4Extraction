Multifocal Central Serous Chorioretinopathy Associated with Steroids in a Patient with Myasthenia Gravis. We present a case of bilateral multifocal central serous chorioretinopathy in a 40-year-old male who suffered from myasthenia gravis and was receiving oral prednisolone. Due to the severity of the underlying disease it was not possible to reduce the corticosteroid dose. After initial unsuccessful treatment with an intravitreal injection of ranibizumab low-fluence photodynamic therapy was performed followed by gradual tapering of the corticosteroids. Visual acuity improved significantly in both eyes. Different therapeutic approaches are.

Introduction. Central serous chorioretinopathy CSCR is a condition characterized by the accumulation of subretinal fluid at the posterior pole of the fundus causing single or multiple areas of serous retinal detachment. The pathophysiology of the disease is thought to involve retinal pigment epithelial RPE dysfunction increased leakage of choriocapillaris vessels and Bruchs membrane dysfunction 1 2. The result of localized exudation is the formation of retinal edema and small RPE detachments at the macular and perimacular areas. Although the aetiology and triggering factors of CSCR are not clearly understood the condition is commonly associated with the use of systemic or topical steroids 2 3. Consequently a critical therapeutic step is the withdrawal of any steroids the patient might be using.Case Rep Ophthalmol 2013416DOI 10.1159/000351856 2013 S.

Multifocal Central Serous Chorioretinopathy Associated with Steroids in a Patient with Myasthenia Gravis2Unfortunately when steroids are indispensable for the treatment of a patients systemic disease the management of CSCR becomes challenging. Here we report our experience in such a clinical setting. Case Report.
He had a history of myasthenia gravis for which he had been treated with oral prednisolone and azathioprine during the last 2 years. His bestcorrected visual acuity BCVA was 8/10 in the right eye OD and 9/10 in the left eye OS.Fundoscopy revealed a few small yellow-whitish circumscribed macular elevations and one larger irregularly shaped parafoveal elevation in OD fig. 1a end. Similar small macular lesions were also noted in OS. Fluorescein angiography showed multiple areas of early hyperfluorescence and late leakage in OD fig. 1b c end. Similar but less pronounced angiography findings were seen in OS fig. 1d end. Optical coherence tomography OCT revealed RPE detachment elevation of the neurosensory retina and highly reflective subretinal fluid mostly in OD fig. 1e.The diagnosis of multifocal CSCR was made. As the patients myasthenia could not be optimally controlled at the time the treating neurologist advised against prednisolone discontinuation. Unfortunately we noticed further deterioration of the BCVA and subfoveal expansion of the subretinal fluid in OD so it was decided to administer an intravitreal injection of ranibizumab in this eye. One month later his BCVA had deteriorated to 3/10 in OD and 7/10 in OS.
OCT demonstrated further elevation of the neurosensory retina and a more irregular subretinal accumulation of highly reflective material fig. 2 end. Indocyanine green angiography excluded neovascularization and polyp-like vascular abnormalities. Low-fluence photodynamic therapy PDT was performed. We administered verteporfin i.v. at a dose of 6 mg/m2 over 10 min waited for 5 min and then directed the diode laser at the larger lesion of leakage in OD using a wavelength of 689 nm and laser energy of 25 mJ/cm2. After the first application the laser spot was directed at the second and the third lesion of leakage in OD fig. 3a end. As the patients myasthenic symptoms improved it became possible for the attending neurologist to reduce the dose of prednisolone increase the dose of azathioprine and add neostigmine. One month later and while undergoing prednisolone tapering his BCVA in OD had improved to 6/10 with no subretinal fluid while the area with the fibrin deposition had nearly disappeared fig. 3b end. The BCVA in OS improved to 10/10 over the next couple of months. To date 1 year after treatment the patients BCVA remains stable at 6/10 in OD and 10/10 in OS with no signs of active disease. The patients myasthenia is currently well controlled with azathioprine and neostigmine.
