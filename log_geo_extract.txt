KEY WORDS: radiolarian fo ssil, sponge spicule,   Guadalupian (Middle Permian), Bancheng Formation, Qinzhou allochthon, paleobathy-metry.   INTRODUCTION   The Ordovician to Upper Permian siliceous rock   Page Number: 1Ito Tsuyoshi, Lei Zhang, Qinglai Feng and Matsuoka Atsushi 146   strata, included in the Qinzhou allochthon, are distrib-  uted in the Qinzhou Basin, South China (Wang and Jin, 2000). Strata from the Upper Carboniferous to Upper Permian sequences comprise the Bancheng Formation (Wang Y J et al., 1998  Bureau of Geology and Min-eral Resources of Guangxi Autonomous Region, 1997), the lithofacies that are characterized by sili-ceous fossil-bearing rocks. Th ese features indicate that   the Bancheng Formation is suitable for analysis of long-term paleoenvironmental fluctuation during the Late Paleozoic. However, the paleoenvironment of this formation has been va guely consider ed as deep   facies. Radiolarians and spo nge spicules are useful in-  dicators of paleowater depth (e.g., He, 2006  Murchey, 2004  He et al., 1999  Kuwahara, 1999  Kozur, 1993). Although Late Permian radiolarian assemblages from Qinzhou have been studied in detail (e.g., Wang et al., 2006  Sun and Xia, 2003), the previous studies of Lower or Middle Permian have been limited to Al-baillellaria, which is a major index order among Late Paleozoic radiolarians (Wang and Yang, 2011, 2007  Zhang et al., 2010  Wang Y J et al., 2006, 1998  Sun et al., 2002  Wu et al., 1994).   We obtained well-preserved radiolarian fossils   and sponge spicules from Guadalupian (Middle Per-mian) bedded siliceous rocks of the Gujingling Sec-tion belonging to the Bancheng Formation of the Qinzhou allochthon in the Xiaodong area of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, South China. In this contribution, we report Guadalupian radiolarian and sponge spicule assemblages from the Gujingling Sec-tion and their faunal features. In addition, we discuss the paleoenvironment of the Bancheng Formation in Guadalupian based on its lithological and faunal characteristics.      GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND LITHOSTRATIGRAPHY OF THE STUDY SECTION   Defined by gray-yellow or brown-gray   thin-bedded siliceous rocks, muddy siliceous rocks, siliceous shales, and mudstones, the Bancheng Forma-tion is lithostratigraphically located between the  Devonian– Carboniferous Shijia and Upper Permian   Pengjiu formations (Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources of Guangxi Autonomous Region, 1997). It conformably overlies the former and unconformably underlies the acidic lava of the latter.
Failed to process chunk  In addition to ra-diolaria and sponge, several fossils such as conodonts, brachiopods, and bivalves have been observed in this formation (Zhang et al., 2010  Wang C Y et al., 1998  Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources of Guangxi Autonomous Region, 1997). Wang et al. (1995) de-duced the paleoenvironment of the Bancheng Forma-tion from geochemical data of cherts in the Qinzhou area. Based on the abundant siliceous fossils and ab-  sence of intense Ce anomaly, they concluded that the   cherts were deposited under a deep or bathyal sea with minor contribution of hydrothermal activity. Wang and Jin (2000) determined from the lack of clastic influx that the Qinzhou allochthon was located hundreds of kilometers east of the South China Block, which sup-plied the clastic debris.   The Gujingling Section (22°12.196 ′N,   108°36.943 ′E), situated 2 km southwest of Xiaodong,   Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China (Fig. 1), outcrops along the south side of the Nanning-Beihai railway. These strata approximately strike N-S and dip 70°W. This section belongs to the Bancheng Forma-tion and is composed of red-to-yellow red cherts and yellow-to-yellow brown siliceous siltstones (Fig. 2). Microscope observation revealed that these siliceous siltstones consist of scattered subrounded quartz and siliceous microfossils such as radiolaria and sponges with clay materials (Figs. 3a, 3c, and 3d). In addition,   these siltstones contain silt-sized quartz and no sand-sized materials. Microscope observation revealed that the cherts in the Gujingling Section consist mainly of cryptocrystalline quartz and siliceous mi-crofossils with a few clay minerals (Fig. 3b).      MATERIALS AND METHODS   We divided the Gujingling Section into 13 sub-  sections for sampling purposes (Fig. 2). Twenty-six samples were collected from the section. The samples were crushed to fragments of approximately 1 cm and were soaked in an approximately 3% hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution for 24 hours at room temperature. The HF solutions were removed and the containers holding the etched samples were subsequently refilled with a fresh HF solution. This process was repeated about 10 times.

Adequate residues were then collected through a   sieve with a mesh diameter of 0.054 mm and dried for examination under a binocular microscope. The well-preserved radiolarians were later mounted on stubs and photographed with a scanning electron mi-croscope for more detailed observation.      FOSSIL OCCURRENCE   The occurrences of microfossils and their hori-  zons are shown in Fig. 2. Most samples contained ra-diolarians and sponge spicules. Selected radiolarian photomicrographs are shown in Figs. 4 and 5  photo-micrographs of selected sponge spicules are shown in Fig. 6. Radiolarians were generally more abundant than sponge spicules in all samples, except sample 2-B  their preservation varied from good to slightly poor. Twenty-five radiolarian species were identified from the Gujingling Section. The faunas of the section commonly consisted of abundant Albaillellaria and spherical radiolaria with minor Latentifistularia and Entactinaria. Samples 3-A, 4-A, 5-A, and 6-A yielded a greater amount of Latentifistularia and Entactinaria than Albaillellaria. The faunas of sponge spicules were generally composed of abundant monaxons and com-mon triaxons with rare anatriaene and very rare   polyaxons.      RADIOLARIAN BIOSTRATIGRAPHY   Three successive radiolarian assemblage-zones   were recognized in the Gujingling Section in the fol-lowing ascending order: Pseudoalbaillella sp. aff.

In summary, the radiolarian assemblage-zones   are assignable to the foll owing chronostratigraphic   units: the Pseudoalbaillella sp. aff. P . longicornis-P .   fusiformis assemblage-zone correlates to the Wordian,   the F . monacanthus assemblage-zone to the Lower   Capitanian, and the F . scholasticus-F . porrectus     assemblage-zone to the Upper Capitanian.      PALEODEPTH OF THE GUJINGLING SECTION   The proportion of siliceous microfossils from the   Gujingling Section is generally characterized by the dominance of radiolaria. The radiolarian assemblages of the section commonly consist of abundant Albail-lellaria and spherical radiolaria with minor Latentifis-tularia and Entactinaria. The sponge spicules from the Gujingling Section are composed of abundant monax-ons and common triaxons with rare anatriaene and very rare polyaxons. The triaxons originate from hex-actinellids  anatriaene originates from demosponges (Murchey, 2004). Hence, the sponge fauna consists mainly of hexactinellids with minor demosponges.   Murchey (2004) investigated the relationship   between the fauna and proportion of siliceous micro-fossils from the siliceous rocks and divided the Phos-phoria Basin in the western United States into the eastern, central, and western belts. The results showed that the fauna and proportion of radiolarians and sponges are well correlated with water depth. Beds in   Page Number: 8Guadalupian (Middle Permian) Radiolarian and Sponge Spicule Faunas from th e Bancheng Formation 153  the eastern belt deposited in a shallow basin are char-  acterized by a high proportion of sponge spicules to radiolaria and dominant demosponge-derived sponge spicules such as rhax and strongyle. In contrast, the deeper western belt shows a low ratio of sponge spi-cules to radiolarians and dominant hexactinellid-  derived sponge spicules such as triaxons. The central belt exhibits intermediate features between the eastern and the western belts. The Bancheng Formation in the Gujingling Section resembles the cherts and siliceous mudstones from the western belt with characteristic low proportions of sponge spicules and dominant hexactinellid-derived sponge spicules. Based on the paleobathymetric model of spicule population in Murchey (2004), the mini mum inferred paleobathy-  metric range of the Gujingling Section is approxi-mately 1 000 m.   Kozur (1993) also investigated the relationship   between radiolarian fauna and paleobathymetry from the Delaware Basin in West Texas, United States. Ac-cording to his results, Copicyntrinae is dominant in basins shallower than 50 m, whereas Entactinaria is dominant in an intermediate basin from 50 to 500 m in depth. Albaillellaria and Phanicosphaera are dominant in basins deeper than 500 m. The radiolarian fauna of the Gujingling Section is dominated by Albaillellaria, which indicates that the section was formed in a basin deeper than 500 m.   These results indicate that the Gujingling Section   belonging to the Bancheng Formation was deposited in a basin deeper than 1 000 m.      PALEOLOCATION OF THE GUJINGLING SECTION   Wang and Jin (2000) speculated that the Qinzhou   allochthon including the Bancheng Formation was lo-cated hundreds of kilometers east of the South China Block until the Guadalupian because its lithofacies do not include clastic rocks of continental origin.   The siliceous siltstones from the Gujingling Sec-  tion are characterized by an inclusion of silt-sized   quartz and no inclusion of sand-sized materials. The latter characteristic suggests that the Gujingling Sec-tion was not formed near a co ntinent. Silt-sized quartz   grains can move several thousand kilometers as eolian dust in a Cenozoic ocean. Okamoto et al. (2002) dis-covered quartz from the Pleistocene deep-sea sedi-ment core in the Hess Rise in the central North Pacific.   They compared the grain size distribution of quartz from the core with that from the Chinese Loess Pla-teau. They concluded that th e quartz moved as eolian   dust from the Chinese Loess Plateau positioned sev-eral thousand kilometers from the core. Therefore, the silt-sized quartz in the section may originate from a continent as eolian dust.   These results suggest that the Bancheng Forma-  tion in the Gujingling Section was located at least a few hundred kilometers from the South China Block in Guadalupian, which supports the speculation of Wang and Jin (2000).      CONCLUSIONS   1. The Gujingling Section consists of red-to-   yellow red cherts and yellow-to-yellow brown sili-ceous siltstones.   2.
Failed to process chunk  Three successive radiolarian assemblage-zones   are recognized in the Gujingling Section in the fol-lowing ascending order: Pseudoalbaillella sp. aff. P.   longicornis-P . fusiformis , F . monacanthus , and F.   scholasticus-F . porrectus . These assemblage-zones   correlate to the Wordian, Lower Capitanian, and Up-per Capitanian, respectively.   3. The radiolarian contents are generally higher   than that of sponge spicules. The radiolarian fauna from the section commonly consists of abundant Al-baillellaria and spherical radiolaria with minor Laten-tifistularia and Entactinaria. The sponge faunas from the section are composed ma inly of hexactinellids   with minor demosponges.   4. The siliceous fossil faunal features are compa-  rable with those from a deep basin of the western belt of the Phosphoria Basin in the western United States, which indicates that the Bancheng Formation in the Gujingling Section was deposited in a basin deeper than 1 000 m.   5. The siliceous siltstones in the section are   characterized by inclusion of silt-sized quartz and no inclusion of sand-sized materials. These characteris-tics suggest that the Gujingling Section belonging to the Bancheng Formation was located at least a few hundred kilometers from the South China Block in the Guadalupian time.

Three successive radiolarian assemblage-zones related to   the Guadalupian (Middle Permian) appear in the section in the following ascending order: Pseudoal-  baillella sp. aff. Pseudoalbaillella longicornis- Pseudoalbaillella fusiformis , Follicucullus monacanthus ,   and Follicucullus scholasticus -Follicucullus porrectus . The radiolarian content in this section is gener-  ally greater than that of sponge spicules. The ra diolarian fauna commonly consists of abundant Albail-  lellaria and spherical radiolaria with minor Latent ifistularia and Entactinaria. The sponge fauna is   composed mainly of hexactinellids with minor demo sponges. These siliceous fossil faunal features,   comparable with those in a deep basin of the we stern belt of the Phosphoria Basin in the western   United States, indicate that the Bancheng Formation in the Gujingling Section was deposited in a basin   deeper than 1 000 m.

KEY WORDS: radiolarian fo ssil, sponge spicule,   Guadalupian (Middle Permian), Bancheng Formation, Qinzhou allochthon, paleobathy-metry.   INTRODUCTION   The Ordovician to Upper Permian siliceous rock   Page Number: 1Ito Tsuyoshi, Lei Zhang, Qinglai Feng and Matsuoka Atsushi 146   strata, included in the Qinzhou allochthon, are distrib-  uted in the Qinzhou Basin, South China (Wang and Jin, 2000). Strata from the Upper Carboniferous to Upper Permian sequences comprise the Bancheng Formation (Wang Y J et al., 1998  Bureau of Geology and Min-eral Resources of Guangxi Autonomous Region, 1997), the lithofacies that are characterized by sili-ceous fossil-bearing rocks. Th ese features indicate that   the Bancheng Formation is suitable for analysis of long-term paleoenvironmental fluctuation during the Late Paleozoic. However, the paleoenvironment of this formation has been va guely consider ed as deep   facies. Radiolarians and spo nge spicules are useful in-  dicators of paleowater depth (e.g., He, 2006  Murchey, 2004  He et al., 1999  Kuwahara, 1999  Kozur, 1993). Although Late Permian radiolarian assemblages from Qinzhou have been studied in detail (e.g., Wang et al., 2006  Sun and Xia, 2003), the previous studies of Lower or Middle Permian have been limited to Al-baillellaria, which is a major index order among Late Paleozoic radiolarians (Wang and Yang, 2011, 2007  Zhang et al., 2010  Wang Y J et al., 2006, 1998  Sun et al., 2002  Wu et al., 1994).   We obtained well-preserved radiolarian fossils   and sponge spicules from Guadalupian (Middle Per-mian) bedded siliceous rocks of the Gujingling Sec-tion belonging to the Bancheng Formation of the Qinzhou allochthon in the Xiaodong area of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, South China. In this contribution, we report Guadalupian radiolarian and sponge spicule assemblages from the Gujingling Sec-tion and their faunal features. In addition, we discuss the paleoenvironment of the Bancheng Formation in Guadalupian based on its lithological and faunal characteristics.      GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND LITHOSTRATIGRAPHY OF THE STUDY SECTION   Defined by gray-yellow or brown-gray   thin-bedded siliceous rocks, muddy siliceous rocks, siliceous shales, and mudstones, the Bancheng Forma-tion is lithostratigraphically located between the  Devonian– Carboniferous Shijia and Upper Permian   Pengjiu formations (Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources of Guangxi Autonomous Region, 1997). It conformably overlies the former and unconformably underlies the acidic lava of the latter.
Failed to process chunk  In addition to ra-diolaria and sponge, several fossils such as conodonts, brachiopods, and bivalves have been observed in this formation (Zhang et al., 2010  Wang C Y et al., 1998  Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources of Guangxi Autonomous Region, 1997). Wang et al. (1995) de-duced the paleoenvironment of the Bancheng Forma-tion from geochemical data of cherts in the Qinzhou area. Based on the abundant siliceous fossils and ab-  sence of intense Ce anomaly, they concluded that the   cherts were deposited under a deep or bathyal sea with minor contribution of hydrothermal activity. Wang and Jin (2000) determined from the lack of clastic influx that the Qinzhou allochthon was located hundreds of kilometers east of the South China Block, which sup-plied the clastic debris.   The Gujingling Section (22°12.196 ′N,   108°36.943 ′E), situated 2 km southwest of Xiaodong,   Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China (Fig. 1), outcrops along the south side of the Nanning-Beihai railway. These strata approximately strike N-S and dip 70°W. This section belongs to the Bancheng Forma-tion and is composed of red-to-yellow red cherts and yellow-to-yellow brown siliceous siltstones (Fig. 2). Microscope observation revealed that these siliceous siltstones consist of scattered subrounded quartz and siliceous microfossils such as radiolaria and sponges with clay materials (Figs. 3a, 3c, and 3d). In addition,   these siltstones contain silt-sized quartz and no sand-sized materials. Microscope observation revealed that the cherts in the Gujingling Section consist mainly of cryptocrystalline quartz and siliceous mi-crofossils with a few clay minerals (Fig. 3b).      MATERIALS AND METHODS   We divided the Gujingling Section into 13 sub-  sections for sampling purposes (Fig. 2). Twenty-six samples were collected from the section. The samples were crushed to fragments of approximately 1 cm and were soaked in an approximately 3% hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution for 24 hours at room temperature. The HF solutions were removed and the containers holding the etched samples were subsequently refilled with a fresh HF solution. This process was repeated about 10 times.

Index map of the study area (modified from Wang and Jin, 2000).      Adequate residues were then collected through a   sieve with a mesh diameter of 0.054 mm and dried for examination under a binocular microscope. The well-preserved radiolarians were later mounted on stubs and photographed with a scanning electron mi-croscope for more detailed observation.      FOSSIL OCCURRENCE   The occurrences of microfossils and their hori-  zons are shown in Fig. 2. Most samples contained ra-diolarians and sponge spicules. Selected radiolarian photomicrographs are shown in Figs. 4 and 5  photo-micrographs of selected sponge spicules are shown in Fig. 6. Radiolarians were generally more abundant than sponge spicules in all samples, except sample 2-B  their preservation varied from good to slightly poor. Twenty-five radiolarian species were identified from the Gujingling Section. The faunas of the section commonly consisted of abundant Albaillellaria and spherical radiolaria with minor Latentifistularia and Entactinaria. Samples 3-A, 4-A, 5-A, and 6-A yielded a greater amount of Latentifistularia and Entactinaria than Albaillellaria. The faunas of sponge spicules were generally composed of abundant monaxons and com-mon triaxons with rare anatriaene and very rare   polyaxons.      RADIOLARIAN BIOSTRATIGRAPHY   Three successive radiolarian assemblage-zones   were recognized in the Gujingling Section in the fol-lowing ascending order: Pseudoalbaillella sp. aff.   Pseudoalbaillella longicornis-Pseudoalbaillella fusi-formis , Follicucullus monacanthus , and Follicucullus   scholasticus-Follicucullus porrectus .   The Pseudoalbaillella sp. aff.

The Pseudoal-  baillella sp. aff. P . longicornis-P . fusiformis      assemblage-zone corresponds to the Pseudoalbaillella globosa assemblage-zone from the pelagic cherts of Southwest Japan (Ishiga, 1990, 1986) and the oceanic facies of South China (Wang and Yang, 2011) in addi-tion to the Pseudoalbaillella longtanensis-P . fusi-  formis assemblage-zone from the outer shelf facies of   the Yangtze region in South China (Kametaka et al., 2009). According to Kametaka et al. (2009), the P.   longtanensis-P . fusiformis assemblage-zone correlates   to the Wordian age or younger based on conodont and ammonoid occurrences.   The F . monacanthus assemblage-zone is situated   in the middle part of the Gujingling Section (GJL 6-B to 12-B).

Failed to process chunk  Three successive radiolarian assemblage-zones   are recognized in the Gujingling Section in the fol-lowing ascending order: Pseudoalbaillella sp. aff. P.   longicornis-P . fusiformis , F . monacanthus , and F.   scholasticus-F . porrectus . These assemblage-zones   correlate to the Wordian, Lower Capitanian, and Up-per Capitanian, respectively.   3. The radiolarian contents are generally higher   than that of sponge spicules. The radiolarian fauna from the section commonly consists of abundant Al-baillellaria and spherical radiolaria with minor Laten-tifistularia and Entactinaria. The sponge faunas from the section are composed ma inly of hexactinellids   with minor demosponges.   4. The siliceous fossil faunal features are compa-  rable with those from a deep basin of the western belt of the Phosphoria Basin in the western United States, which indicates that the Bancheng Formation in the Gujingling Section was deposited in a basin deeper than 1 000 m.   5. The siliceous siltstones in the section are   characterized by inclusion of silt-sized quartz and no inclusion of sand-sized materials. These characteris-tics suggest that the Gujingling Section belonging to the Bancheng Formation was located at least a few hundred kilometers from the South China Block in the Guadalupian time.

PALEODEPTH OF THE GUJINGLING SECTION   The proportion of siliceous microfossils from the   Gujingling Section is generally characterized by the dominance of radiolaria. The radiolarian assemblages of the section commonly consist of abundant Albail-lellaria and spherical radiolaria with minor Latentifis-tularia and Entactinaria. The sponge spicules from the Gujingling Section are composed of abundant monax-ons and common triaxons with rare anatriaene and very rare polyaxons. The triaxons originate from hex-actinellids  anatriaene originates from demosponges (Murchey, 2004). Hence, the sponge fauna consists mainly of hexactinellids with minor demosponges.   Murchey (2004) investigated the relationship   between the fauna and proportion of siliceous micro-fossils from the siliceous rocks and divided the Phos-phoria Basin in the western United States into the eastern, central, and western belts. The results showed that the fauna and proportion of radiolarians and sponges are well correlated with water depth. Beds in   Page Number: 8Guadalupian (Middle Permian) Radiolarian and Sponge Spicule Faunas from th e Bancheng Formation 153  the eastern belt deposited in a shallow basin are char-  acterized by a high proportion of sponge spicules to radiolaria and dominant demosponge-derived sponge spicules such as rhax and strongyle. In contrast, the deeper western belt shows a low ratio of sponge spi-cules to radiolarians and dominant hexactinellid-  derived sponge spicules such as triaxons. The central belt exhibits intermediate features between the eastern and the western belts. The Bancheng Formation in the Gujingling Section resembles the cherts and siliceous mudstones from the western belt with characteristic low proportions of sponge spicules and dominant hexactinellid-derived sponge spicules. Based on the paleobathymetric model of spicule population in Murchey (2004), the mini mum inferred paleobathy-  metric range of the Gujingling Section is approxi-mately 1 000 m.   Kozur (1993) also investigated the relationship   between radiolarian fauna and paleobathymetry from the Delaware Basin in West Texas, United States. Ac-cording to his results, Copicyntrinae is dominant in basins shallower than 50 m, whereas Entactinaria is dominant in an intermediate basin from 50 to 500 m in depth. Albaillellaria and Phanicosphaera are dominant in basins deeper than 500 m. The radiolarian fauna of the Gujingling Section is dominated by Albaillellaria, which indicates that the section was formed in a basin deeper than 500 m.   These results indicate that the Gujingling Section   belonging to the Bancheng Formation was deposited in a basin deeper than 1 000 m.      PALEOLOCATION OF THE GUJINGLING SECTION   Wang and Jin (2000) speculated that the Qinzhou   allochthon including the Bancheng Formation was lo-cated hundreds of kilometers east of the South China Block until the Guadalupian because its lithofacies do not include clastic rocks of continental origin.   The siliceous siltstones from the Gujingling Sec-  tion are characterized by an inclusion of silt-sized   quartz and no inclusion of sand-sized materials. The latter characteristic suggests that the Gujingling Sec-tion was not formed near a co ntinent. Silt-sized quartz   grains can move several thousand kilometers as eolian dust in a Cenozoic ocean. Okamoto et al. (2002) dis-covered quartz from the Pleistocene deep-sea sedi-ment core in the Hess Rise in the central North Pacific.   They compared the grain size distribution of quartz from the core with that from the Chinese Loess Pla-teau. They concluded that th e quartz moved as eolian   dust from the Chinese Loess Plateau positioned sev-eral thousand kilometers from the core. Therefore, the silt-sized quartz in the section may originate from a continent as eolian dust.   These results suggest that the Bancheng Forma-  tion in the Gujingling Section was located at least a few hundred kilometers from the South China Block in Guadalupian, which supports the speculation of Wang and Jin (2000).      CONCLUSIONS   1. The Gujingling Section consists of red-to-   yellow red cherts and yellow-to-yellow brown sili-ceous siltstones.   2.
